<b>Linear Equations</b>
<br><br>

<b>Objective:</b> Solve general linear equations including equations with variables on both sides by balancing and using inverse operations.<br><br>


Solving linear equations is an important and fundamental skill in algebra. In algebra, we are often presented with a problem where the answer is known, but part of the problem is missing. The missing part of the problem is what we seek to find. An example of such a problem is shown below. <br><br>


<b>Example 3A-1:</b>
<br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4x + 16= -4$</td>


  </tr>


</table></center>

<br><br>

Notice the above problem has a missing part, or unknown, that is marked by $x$. If we are given that the solution to this equation is $-5$, it could be plugged into the equation, replacing the $x$ with $-5$. This is shown in Example 3A-2. <br><br>

<b>Example 3A-2:</b>
<br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4(-5) + 16$</td>

    <td>Multiply $4(-5)</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$-20+ 16$</td>

    <td>Add $-20+ 16$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$-4$</td>

    <td>$-4=-4$: The left-hand side equals the right-hand side-- <b>LHS=RHS</b></td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<br><br>

Now the equation comes out to a true statement! Notice also that if another number, for example, $3$, were plugged in for $x$, we would not get a true statement as seen in Example 3A-3.

<br><br>


<b>Example 3A-3:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4(3) + 16$</td>

    <td>Multiply $4(3)$</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$12+ 16$</td>

    <td>Add $12+ 16$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$28$</td>

    <td>$28\neq -4$: The left-hand side does not equal the right-hand side-- <b>LHS $\neq$ RHS</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>


<br><br>


Due to the fact that this is not a true statement, this demonstrates that $3$ is not the solution. However, depending on the complexity of the problem, this "guess and check" method is not very efficient. Thus, we take a more algebraic approach to solving equations. Here we will focus on what are called "one-step equations" or equations that only require one step to solve. While these equations often seem very fundamental, it is important to master the pattern for solving these problems so we can solve more complex problems.

<br><br>


<b>Addition Problems </b>
<br><br>

To solve equations, the general rule is to do the opposite. For example, consider the following:<br><br>

<b>Example 3A-4:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$x +7= -5$</td>

    <td>Notice the $7$ is added to the $x$.</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$(x +7)-7= (-5)-7$</td>

    <td>Subtract $7$ from both sides to isolate $x$.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$x = -12$</td>

    <td>Our solution!</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>


<br><br>


Then we get our solution, $x = -12$. The same process is used in each of the following examples.
<br><br>


<b>Example 3A-5:</b><br>

<center>

$\matrix{ 4+ x = 8 & 7= x +9 & 5=8+ x  \cr 
               \underline{ -4 \,\,\,\,\,\, -4} & \underline{-9 \,\,\,\,\,\, -9} & \underline{-8\, \, -8 \,\,\,\,\,\,\,} \cr
                 x =4 & -2 = x & -3 = x }$


</center>

Table 1. Addition Examples</center>

<br><br>


<b>Subtraction Problems</b>
In a subtraction problem, we "counteract" negative numbers by adding them to both sides of the equation. For example, consider the following:
<br><br>


<b>Example 3A-6:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$x-5=4$</td>

    <td>Notice $5$ is  subtracted from $x$.</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$(x-5)+5=4+5$</td>

    <td>Add $5$ to both sides of the equation to solve for $x$.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>
$x =9$</td>

    <td>Our solution!</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>


<br><br>

Then we get our solution $x =9$. The same process is used in each of the following examples. Notice that each time we are "eliminating" a negative number by adding.
<br><br>


<b>Example 3A-7:</b><br>

<center>

$\matrix{ -6+x=-2 & -10=x-7 & 5=-8+x\cr
               \underline{ +6 \,\,\,\,\,\, +6} & \underline{+7 \,\,\,\,\,\, +7} & \underline{-8\, \, -8 \,\,\,\,\,\,\,} \cr
                 x =4 & -3 = x & 13 = x }$


</center> <br><br>


<b>Multiplication Problems</b>

<br><br>
With a multiplication problem, we "eliminate" a constant multiple by multiplying by the reciprocal (or dividing) on both sides. For example consider the followiing:
<br><br>
<b>Example 3A-8:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4x = 20$</td>

    <td>Notice the constant multiple $4$ times the variable $x$.</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$\frac{1}{4}(4x) = \frac{1}{4}\cdot 20$</td>

    <td>Multiply both sides by $\frac{1}{4}$ (or divide both sides by $4$).</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$x = 5$</td>

    <td>Our solution!</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>


<br><br>


Then we get our solution  $x = 5$.
<br><br>

With multiplication problems it is very important that care is taken with signs. If $x$ is multiplied by a negative then we will divide by a negative. This is shown in Example 3A-9.
<br><br>
<b>Example 3A-9:</b>
<br>
<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$-5x = 30$</td>

    <td> $x$ is multiplied by $-5$</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$-\frac{1}{5}(-5x) = -\frac{1}{5}\cdot30$</td>

    <td>Multiply both sides by $-\frac{1}{5}$ (or divide both sides by $-5$)</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$x = -6$</td>

    <td>Our solution!</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>


<br><br>


The same process is used in each of the following examples. Notice how negative and positive numbers are handled as each problem is solved.
<br><br>

 <b>Example 3A-10:</b><br>
 
 <center>

$\matrix{ 8x=-24 & -4x=-20 & 42=7x\cr
               \frac{1}{8}(8x)=(-24)\frac{1}{8} & -\frac{1}{4}(-4x)=(-20)(-\frac{1}{4}) & \frac{1}{7}\cdot 42=\frac{1}{7}(7x) \cr
                 x =-3 & x=5 & 6=x}$


</center>

<br><br>


<b>Division Problems:</b>

<br><br>

In division problems, "eliminate the denominator" by multiplying on both sides. For example consider: <br><br>

<b>Example 3A-11:</b>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$\frac{x}{5}=-3$</td>

    <td>Variable $x$ is divided by $5$</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>(5)$\frac{x}{5}=-3(5)$</td>

    <td>Multiply both sides by $5$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$x = -15$</td>

    <td>Our solution!</td>
  </tr>
</table></center>


<br><br>

Then we get our solution $x = -15$. The same process is used in each of the following examples.
<br><br>



<b>Example 3A-12:</b><br>

 <center>

$\matrix{ \frac{x}{-7}=-2 & \frac{x}{8}=5 & \frac{x}{-4}=9\cr
               (-7)\frac{x}{-7}=-2(-7) & (8)\frac{x}{8}=5(8) & (-4)\frac{x}{-4}=9(-4)\cr
                 x =14 & x=40 & x=-36}$


</center>

<br><br>


The process described above is fundamental to solving equations. Once this process is mastered, the problems we will see have several more steps. These problems may seem more complex, but the process and patterns used will remain the same.
<br><br>


<b>World View Note:</b> The study of algebra originally was called the “Cossic Art” from the Latin,the study of "things" (which we now call variables).

<br><br>

<b>Linear Equations - Two-Step Equations</b> <br><br>

After mastering the technique for solving equations that are one-step equations,
we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we solve two-step equations,
the important thing to remember is that everything works backwards!
When working with one-step equations, we learned that in order to clear a "plus
five" in the equation, we would subtract five from both sides. We learned that to
clear "divided by seven" we multiply by seven on both sides. The same pattern
applies to the order of operations. When solving for our variable x, we use order
of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or subtract first, then
multiply or divide second (then exponents, and finally any parentheses or
grouping symbols, but that’s another lesson). So to solve the equation in the first
example, <br><br>

<b>Example 3A-13:</b>
<br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4x + -20= -8$</td>


  </tr>


</table></center>

<br><br>

We have two numbers on the same side as the variable $x$. We need to handle the $4$ and the $-20$. We know to "eliminate" the four we need to divide, and to "eliminate" the subtracted twenty we will add twenty to both sides. If order of operations is done backwards,
we add or subtract first. Therefore we will add $20$ to both sides first.
Once we are done with that, we will divide both sides by $4$. The steps are shown below. <br><br>

<center>

$\matrix{ 4x\color{red}{-20} = -8 & \text{Start by focusing on the subtract $20$} \cr
               \,\,\,\,\,\underline{+20\,\,+20} & \text{Add $20$  to both sides} \cr
                4x \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = 12 &\text{Now we focus on the $4$ multiplied by $x$}  \cr
                \overline{4} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{4} &\text{Divide both sides by $4$}  \cr
                 x =3 & \text{Our Solution!}}$


</center>

<br><br>

One way we can check the correctness of Our Solution is to substitute $x=3$ back in to the original equation:

<br><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4x-20 = -8$</td>

    <td>Substitute $x=3$ into the <b>LHS</b></td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$4(3)-20$</td>

    <td>Multiply $4(3)$</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>

    <td>$12-20$</td>

    <td>Subtract $12-20$</td>
  </tr>
  
<tr>

    <td>$-8$</td>

    <td>$-8=-8$: The left-hand side equals the right-hand side-- <b>LHS=RHS</b></td>
  </tr>
</table></center>

<br><br>

Since we get a true statement $-8=-8$, Our Solution $x=3$ is correct. <br><br>

The same process is used to solve any two-step equations. Add or subtract first,
then multiply or divide. Consider our next example and notice how the same process is applied. <br><br>

<b>Example 3A-14:</b>
<br>

<center>

$\matrix{ 5x\color{red}{+7} = 7 & \text{Start by focusing on the plus $7$} \cr
               \,\,\,\,\,\underline{-7\,\,-7} & \text{Subtract $7$  from both sides} \cr
                5x \,\,\,\,\,\,\, = 0 &\text{Now we focus on the $5$ multiplied by $x$}  \cr
                \overline{5} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,s \overline{5} &\text{Divide both sides by $5$ --(recall $\frac{0}{5}=0$)}  \cr
                 x =0 & \text{Our Solution!}}$


</center>

<br><br>

Notice the seven subtracted out completely! Many students get stuck on this
point, do not forget that we have a number for "nothing left" and that number is
zero. With this in mind the process is almost identical to our first example. <br><br>

A common error students make with two-step equations is with negative signs.
Remember the sign always stays with the number. Consider the following
example. <br><br>

<b>Example 3A-15:</b>
<br>

<center>

$\matrix{ \color{red}{4}-2x = 10 & \text{Start by focusing on the positive $4$} \cr
               \underline{-4\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-4} & \text{Subtract $4$ from both sides} \cr
                \,\,\,\,\,\,\,-2x  = 6 \,\, &\text{Notice negative $2$ is times $x$}  \cr
                \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{-2} \,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{-2}\,\,\,\,\, &\text{Divide both sides by $-2$}  \cr
                \,\,\,\,\,\,\, x =-3 & \text{Our Solution!}}$


</center>

<br><br>

The same is true even if there the coefficient in front of the variable is a negative $1$. Consider the next example. <br><br>

<b>Example 3A-16:</b>
<br>

<center>

$\matrix{ \color{red}{8}-x = 2 & \text{Start by focusing on the positive $8$} \cr
               \underline{-8\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-8} & \text{Subtract $8$ from both sides} \cr
                \,\,\,\,\,\,\,-x  = -6 \,\, &\text{Notice negative $1$ is times $x$}  \cr
                \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{-1} \,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{-1}\,\,\,\,\, &\text{Divide both sides by $-1$ (or multiply both sides by $-1$)}  \cr
                \,\,\,\,\,\,\, x =6 & \text{Our Solution!}}$


</center>

<br><br>

Solving two-step equations is a very important skill to master, as we study
algebra. The first step is to add or subtract, the second is to multiply or divide.
This pattern is seen in each of the following examples. <br><br>

<b>Example 3A-17:</b>
<br>

<center>

$\matrix{ -3x+7=-8 & -2+9x=7 & 8=2x+10\cr

              \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \underline{-7\,\,\,\,-7} & \underline{+2\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,+2} & \underline{-10\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-10}\cr
              
                 \,\,\,\,-3x=-15 & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,9x=9 & -2=2x\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\cr
                 
                 \,\,\,\,\overline{-3}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{-3} & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{9}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{9} & \overline{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\cr
                 \,\,\,\,x=5 & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,x=1 & -1=x\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,
                 
                 
                 }$
                 
<br><br><br>

$\matrix{ 7-5x=17 & -5-3x=-5 & -3=\frac{x}{5}-4\cr

               \underline{-7\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-7} & \underline{+5\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,+5} & \underline{+4\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,+4}\cr

                 \,\,\,\,-5x=10 & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,3x=0 & (5)1=\frac{x}{5}(5)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\cr

                 \,\,\,\,\overline{-5}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{-5} & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{-3}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{-3} & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\cr
                 \,\,\,\,x=-2 & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,x=0 & 5=x\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,


                 }$

</center>

<br><br>


<b>Solving Linear Equations -General Equations</b>
<br><br>


Often as we are solving linear equations we will need to do some work to set them up into a form we are familiar with solving. This section will focus on manipulating an equation we are asked to solve in such a way that we can use our pattern for solving two-step equations to ultimately arrive at the solution.
<br><br>
One such issue that needs to be addressed is parenthesis. Often the parenthesis can get in the way of solving an otherwise easy problem. As you might expect we can handle the parenthesis by using the distributive property. This is shown in the following example. Notice the first step is distributing, then it is solved like any other two-step equation.
<br><br>

<b>Example 3A-18:</b>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4(2x -6) = 16$</td>

    <td>Distribute $4$ through parenthesis: multiply $4(2)$ and $4(-6)$</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$8x -24= 16$</td>

    <td>Focus on the subtraction first</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+24\,\,\,+ 24}$</td>

    <td>Add $24$ to both sides</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,8x = 40$</td>

    <td>Now focus on the multiplication by $8$</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\overline{\,8\,}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,	\overline{\,8\,}$</td>

    <td>Divide both sides by $8$</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,x =5$</td>

    <td>Our Solution!</td>
  </tr>


</table></center>


<br><br>



Often after we distribute there will be some like terms on one side of the equation. Example 3A-19 shows distributing to "clear" the parenthesis followed by combining like terms. Notice we only combine like terms on the same side of the equation. Once we have done this, our next example solves just like any other two-step equation.
<br><br>


<b>Example 3A-19:</b>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$3(2x -4) + 9 = 15$</td>

    <td>Distribute the $3$ through the parenthesis</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$6x -12+9= 15$</td>

    <td>Combine like terms, $-12+9$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$6x -3= 15$</td>

    <td>Focus on the subtraction first</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+3\,\,\,\, 	+3}$</td>

    <td>Add $3$ to both sides</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,6x = 18$</td>

    <td>Now focus on multiplication by $6$</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{\,6\,}\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{\,6\,}$</td>

    <td>Divide both sides by $6$</td>
  </tr>



  <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,x = 3$</td>

    <td>Our Solution! </td>
  </tr>


</table></center>


<br><br>


A second type of problem that becomes a two-step equation after a bit of work is one where we see the variable on both sides. This is shown in the following example:
<br><br>

<b>Example 3A-20:</b>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4x -6=2x + 10$</td>


  </tr>






</table></center>


<br><br>

Notice here the $x$ is on both the left and right sides of the equation. This can make it difficult to decide which side to work with. We fix this by adding or subtracting one of the terms with $x$ to the other side, much like we do with a constant term. It doesn't matter which term gets added or subtracted, $4x$ or $2x$, however, it would be our suggestion to subtract the smaller term in this case (to avoid negative coefficients). For this reason we begin this problem by  subtracting $2x$ from both sides.

<br><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4x -6=2x + 10$</td>

    <td>Notice the variable $x$ on both sides</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$\underline{-2x\,\,\,\,\, -2x}$</td>

    <td>Subtract $2x$ from both sides</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$2x -6= 10$</td>

    <td>Focus on the subtraction first</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+6\,\,\,\, +6}$</td>

    <td>Add $6$ to both sides</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,2x=16$</td>

    <td>Focus on the multiplication by $2$</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{2}$</td>

    <td>Divide both sides by $2$</td>
  </tr>



  <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, x = 8$</td>

    <td>Our Solution!</td>
  </tr>


</table></center>


<br><br>

The next example shows the check on this solution. Here Our Solution $x=8$ is substituted for the $x$ on both the <b>LHS</b> and<b>RHS</b> before simplifying.

<br><br>

<b>Example 3A-21:</b>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
        <td><b>LHS</b></td> <td>$\,$</td><td>$\,\,\,\,\,$</td> <td><b>RHS</b></td> <td>$\,$</td>
  
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$4(8) -6 $</td>  <td>Multiply $4(8)$</td> <td>$\,\,\,\,\,$</td> 
    <td>$2(8) +10 $</td>  <td>Multiply $2(8)$</td>
    
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$32 -6 $</td>  <td>Subtract</td> <td>$\,\,\,\,\,$</td> 
    <td>$16 +10 $</td>  <td>Add</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$26 $</td>  <td><b>LHS</b> value</td> <td>$\,\,\,\,\,$</td> 
    <td>$26$</td>  <td><b>RHS</b> value</td>
  </tr>

</table></center>

<br><br>
Since $26=26$ we have <b>LHS=RHS</b> which means Our Solution $x=8$ is correct!


<br><br>
The next example illustrates the same process with negative coefficients. Notice first the negative term with the variable is added to both sides. <br><br>

<b>Example 3A-22:</b> <br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$-3x+9=6x-27$</td>

    <td>Notice the variable $x$ on both sides, $-3x$ is negative</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$\underline{+3x\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, +3x\,\,\,\,\,\,}$</td>

    <td>Add $3x$ to both sides</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,9=9x-27$</td>

    <td>Focus on the subtraction of $27$ first</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+27\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, +27}$</td>

    <td>Add $27$ to both sides</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 36=9x$</td>

    <td>Focus on the multiplication by $9$</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{9}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{9}$</td>

    <td>Divide both sides by $9$</td>
  </tr>



  <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 4=x$</td>

    <td>Our Solution!</td>
  </tr>


</table></center>


<br><br>

Linear equations can become particularly interesting when the two processes are combined. In the following problems we have parenthesis and the variable on both sides. Notice in each of the following examples we distribute, then combine like terms, then move the variable to one side of the equation.

<br><br>

<b>Example 3A-23:</b> <br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$2(x-5) + 3x = x + 18$</td>

    <td>Distribute the $2$ through parenthesis</td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr>

    <td>$2x-10 + 3x = x + 18$</td>

    <td>Combine like terms $2x+ 3x$</td>

Sometimes we may have to distribute more than once to clear several parenthesis. Remember to combine like terms after you distribute!

<br><br>

<b>Example 3A-24:</b> <br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$3(4x-5)-4(2x+1)=5$</td>

    <td>Distribute the $3$ and $-4$ through parenthesis</td>
  </tr>

    <tr>

    <td>$12x-15-8x-4=5$</td>

    <td>Combine like terms $12x-8x$ and $-15-4$</td>
  </tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,4x-19=5$</td>

    <td>Focus on the subtraction of $19$</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+19\,\,\,\, +19}$</td>

    <td>Add $19$ to both sides</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 4x=24$</td>

    <td>Focus on the multiplication by $4$</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{4}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{4}$</td>

    <td>Divide both sides by $4$</td>

This leads to a $5$-step process to solve any linear equation. While all five steps aren't always needed, this can serve as a guide to solving equations.
<br><br>
1.
Distribute through any parentheses. <br>

2.
Combine like terms on each side of the equation. <br>

3.
Get the variable on one side by adding or subtracting <br>

4.
Solve the remaining 2-step equation (add or subtract then multiply or divide)
<br>

5. Check your answer by plugging it back in for x to find a true statement.
<br><br>
The order of these steps is very important.<br><br>

<b>World View Note:</b> The Chinese developed a method for solving equations that involved finding each digit one at a time about 2000 years ago! <br><br>

We can see each of the above five steps worked through our next example. <br><br>


<b>Example 3A-25:</b> <br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4(2x -6) + 9 = 3(x -7) + 8x$</td>

    <td>Distribute the $4$ and $3$ through parenthesis</td>
  </tr>

    <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,8x-24+9=3x-21+8x$</td>

    <td>Combine like terms $-24+9$ and $3x+8x$</td>
  </tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,8x-15=11x-21$</td>

    <td>Notice the variable $x$ is on both sides</td>
  </tr>
  
   <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{-8x\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, -8x}$</td>

    <td>Subtract $8x$ from both sides</td>
  </tr>

 <tr>
 
     <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-15=3x-21$</td>

    <td>Focus on the subtraction of $21$</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+21\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\, +21}$</td>

    <td>Add $21$ to both sides</td>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 6=3x$</td>

    <td>Focus on the multiplication by $3$</td>
  </tr>


 <tr>

    <td>$\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{3}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{3}$</td>

    <td>Divide both sides by $3$</td>
