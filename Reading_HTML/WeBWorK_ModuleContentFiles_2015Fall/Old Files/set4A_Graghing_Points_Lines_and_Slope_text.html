<b>Graphing Points, Lines and Slope</b>
<br><br>



<p>Graphing - Points and Lines</p>
<p>Objective: Graph points and lines using $xy$ coordinates.</p>
<p>Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation we will make a picture that
represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solutions
to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a visual representation
of an equation, we first have to understand the basis of graphing. Following
is an example of what is called the coordinate plane.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>The plane is divided into four sections
by a horizontal number line ($x$-axis)
and a vertical number line ($y$-axis).
Where the two lines meet in the center
is called the origin. This center origin
is where $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. As we move
to the right the numbers count up
from zero, representing $x=1, 2, 3$.</td> 
    
  </tr>
 
</table></p>

<p>To the left the numbers count down from zero, representing \(x = - 1, - 2, - 3\)	.
Similarly, as we move up the number count up from zero, $y = 1, 2, 3$	., and as we
move down count down from zero, $y = - 1, - 2, - 3$. We can put dots on the
graph which we will call points. Each point has an “address” that defines its location.
The first number will be the value on the $x$ -axis or horizontal number line.
This is the distance the point moves left/right from the origin. The second
number will represent the value on the $y$ - axis or vertical number line. This is
the distance the point moves up/down from the origin. The points are given as an
ordered pair ($x, y$).</p>
<p>World View Note: Locations on the globe are given in the same manner, each
number is a distance from a central point, the origin which is where the prime
meridian and the equator. This “origin is just off the western coast of Africa.
The following example finds the address or coordinate pair for each of several
points on the coordinate plane.</p>


<p>Example 4A-1</p>
<p>Give the coordinates of each point.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Tracing from the origin, point $A$ is
right $1$, up $4$. This becomes $A(1, 4)$.
Point $B$ is left $5$, up $3$. Left is backwards
or negative so we have $B( - 5$,</td>
    <td>$3)$. $C$ is straight down $2$ units. There
is no left or right. This means we go
right zero so the point is $C(0,-2)$.</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$A(1, 4)$,$B(-5, 3)$,$C(0,-2)$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Just as we can give the coordinates for a set of points, we can take a set of points
and plot them on the plane.</p>

<p>Example 4a-2</p>

<p>Graph the points $A(3, 2), B( - 2, 1), C(3, - 4), D( - 2, - 3), E( - 3, 0), F (0, 2),
G(0, 0)$</p>



<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>The first point, $A$ is at $(3, 2)$ this
means $x=3$ (right $3$) and $y =2$ (up $2$).
Following these instructions, starting
from the origin, we get our point.</br>
The second point, $B( - 2, 1)$, is left $2$
(negative moves backwards), up $1$.
This is also illustrated on the graph.</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>The third point, $C (3, - 4)$ is right $3$,
down $4$ (negative moves backwards).</br>
The fourth point, $D ( - 2, - 3)$ is left
$2$, down $3$ (both negative, both move
backwards)</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>


<p>The last three points have zeros in them. We still treat these points just like the
other points. If there is a zero there is just no movement.</p>


<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>Next is $E(-3, 0)$. This is left $3$ (negative
is backwards), and up zero, right
on the $x$-axis.</br>
Then is $F (0, 2)$. This is right zero,
and up two, right on the $y$ -axis.</br>
Finally is $G(0, 0)$. This point has no
movement. Thus the point is right on
the origin.</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>The main purpose of graphs is not to plot random points, but rather to give a
picture of the solutions to an equation. We may have an equation such as $y =
2x - 3$. We may be interested in what type of solution are possible in this equation.
We can visualize the solution by making a graph of possible $x$ and $y$ combinations
that make this equation a true statement. We will have to start by
finding possible $x$ and $y$ combinations. We will do this using a table of values.</p>


<p>Example 4a-3</p>

<p>Graph $y =2x-3$ We make a table of values</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>$x$</td>
    <td>$y$</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$-1$</td>
    <td></td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td></td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td></td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</td>
    <td>We will test three values for $x$.Any three can be used</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>$x$</td>
    <td>$y$</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$-1$</td>
    <td>$-5$</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$-3$</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$-1$</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></td>
    <td>Evaluate each by replacing xwith the given value
$x=-1$; $y =2(-1)-3=-2-3=-5$</br>
$x=0$; $y =2(0)-3=0-3=-3$</br>
$x=1$; $y =2(1)-3=2-3=-1$</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>These then become the points to graph on our equation</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>Plot each point.
Once the point are on the graph, connect
the dots to make a line.
The graph is our solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>


<p>What this line tells us is that any point on the line will work in the equation $y =
2x -3$. For example, notice the graph also goes through the point $(2, 1)$. If we use
$x=2$, we should get $y =1$. Sure enough, $y =2(2)-3=4-3=1$, just as the graph
suggests. Thus we have the line is a picture of all the solutions for $y = 2x - 3$. We
can use this table of values method to draw a graph of any linear equation.</p>

<p>Graphing - Slope</p>
<p>Objective: Find the slope of a line given a graph or two points.</p>
<p>As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify different properties of the
lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope
is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as $25$, is very steep. A
line with a small slope, such as $1$
$10$ is very flat. We will also use slope to describe
the direction of the line. A line that goes up from left to right will have a positive
slope and a line that goes down from left to right will have a negative slope.
As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to
how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction rise
run.</p>
<p>Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the $y$-values. Run would be a horizontal
change, or a change in the $x$-values. So another way to describe slope
would be the fraction change in $y$
change inx . It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw
vertical and horiztonal lines from one point to another to make what is called a
slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope. The following
examples show graphs that we find the slope of using this idea.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
<td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>To find the slope of this line we will
consider the rise, or verticle change
and the run or horizontal change.
Drawing these lines in makes a slope
triangle that we can use to count from
one point to the next the graph goes
down $4$, right $6$. This is rise $- 4$, run
$6$. As a fraction it would be, $-4$
$6 $.
Reduce the fraction to get $- 2
3$
.</td>
   
  </tr>

Our Solution</p>

<p>World View Note: When French mathematicians Rene Descartes and Pierre de
Fermat first developed the coordinate plane and the idea of graphing lines (and
other functions) the y-axis was not a verticle line!</p>


<p>Example 4a-5</p>



<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>To find the slope of this line, the rise
is up $6$, the run is right $3$. Our slope is
then written as a fraction, rise
run or $6
3 $.
This fraction reduces to $2$. This will
be our slope.</br>
$2$ Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
</table></p>

<p>There are two special lines that have unique slopes that we need to be aware of.
They are illustrated in the following example.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this graph there is no rise, but the
run is $3$ units. This slope becomes
$0
3 = 0$. This line,
and all horizontal lines have a zero slope.</td>
    <td>This line has a rise of $5$, but no run.
The slope becomes $5
0 =$
undefined. This line,
and all vertical lines, have no slope.</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>


<p>As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no
slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first
slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The
second slope can’t get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large
enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.</p>
<p>We can find the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a
graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in $y$ values,
we can calculate this by subtracting the $y$ values of a point. Similarly, if run is a
change in the $x$ values, we can calculate this by subtracting the $x$ values of a
point. In this way we get the following equation for slope.</p>

<p>The slope of a line through $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ is
$y2- y1$
$x2-x1$</p>

<p>When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope.
For this reason we often represent the slope with the variable $m$. Now we have
the following for slope.</p>

<p>Slope$=m=$
rise
run
$=$
change in $y$
change in $x
=
y2- y1
x2-x1$</p>

<p>As we subtract the $y$ values and the $x$ values when calculating slope it is important
we subtract them in the same order. This process is shown in the following
examples.</p>
<p>Example 4a-6</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Find the slope between $(-4, 3)$ and $(2,-9)$</td>
    <td>Identify $x1$, $y1$, $x2$, $y2$</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$</td>
    <td>Use slope formula,$m=
y2- y1
x2-x1$</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$m= -9-3$
$2-(-4)$</td>
    <td>Simplify</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$m= -12/6$ </td>
    <td>Reduce</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$m=-2$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Example 4A-7</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Find the slope between $(4, 6)$ and $(2,-1)$</td>
    <td>Identify $x1, y1, x2, y2$</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)</td>
    <td>Use slope formula, $m=
y2- y1
x2-x1$</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>m= -1-6
2-4</td>
    <td>Simplify</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$m= -7

    <td>Reduce, dividing by $-1$</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$m=
7
2$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>We may come up against a problem that has a zero slope (horiztonal line) or no
slope (vertical line) just as with using the graphs.</p>


<p>Example 4A-8</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Find the slope between $(-4,-1)$ and $(-4,-5)$</td>
    <td></td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$(x1 , y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$</td>
    <td>Use slope formula,$m=
y2- y1
x2-x1$</td>

  <tr>
    <td>$m= -5-(-1)
-4-(-4)$</td>
    <td>Simplify</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$m= -4
0$</td>
    <td>Can't divide by zero, undefined</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$m=$no slope</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>


<p>Example 4A-9</p>


<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Find the slope between $(3, 1)$ and $(-2, 1)$</td>
    <td>Identify $x1, y1, x2, y2$</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2$)</td>
    <td>Use slope formula,$m=
y2- y1
x2-x1$</td> 
   
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$m=
1-1
-2-3$</td>
    <td>Simplify</td> 
   
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$m=
0
-5$</td>
    <td>Reduce</td> 
   
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$m=0$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Again, there is a big difference between no slope and a zero slope. Zero is an
integer and it has a value, the slope of a flat horizontal line. No slope has no
value, it is undefined, the slope of a vertical line.</p>
<p>Using the slope formula we can also find missing points if we know what the slope
is. This is shown in the following two examples.</p>
<p>Example 4A-10</p>

<p>Find the value of y between the points $(2, y)$ and $(5,-1)$ with slope $-3$</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>$m=
y2- y1
x2-x1$</td>
    <td>We will plug values into slope formula</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$-3= -1- y
5-2$</td>
    <td>Simplify</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-3= -1- y$</td>
    <td>Multiply both sides by $3$</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-3(3)= -1- y

(3)$</td>
    <td>Simplify</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-9=-1- y$</td>
    <td>Add $1$ to both sides</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-8=- y$</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by $-1$</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$8= y$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>
