<b>Solve and Graph Inequalities</b>
<p><b>Inequalities - Solve and Graph Inequalities</b></p>

<p>Objective: Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution to
linear inequalities.</p>
<p>When we have an equation such as $x = 4$ we have a specific value for our variable.
With inequalities we will give a range of values for our variable. To do this we
will not use equals, but one of the following symbols:</p>




<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$>$</td>
    <td>Greater than</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$>$</td>
    <td>Greater than or equal to</td> 
   
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$<$</td>
    <td>Less than</td> 
   
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$6$</td>
    <td>Less than or equal to</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>World View Note: English mathematician Thomas Harriot first used the above
symbols in 1631. However, they were not immediately accepted as symbols such
as ? and ? were already coined by another English mathematician, William
Oughtred.</p>
<p>If we have an expression such as $x<4$, this means our variable can be any number
smaller than $4$ such as $- 2, 0, 3, 3.9$ or even $3.999999999$ as long as it is smaller than $4$. If we have an expression such as $x > - 2$, this means our variable can be
any number greater than or equal to $-2$, such as $5, 0,-1,-1.9999$, or even $-2.$</p>
<p>Because we don’t have one set value for our variable, it is often useful to draw a
picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. We will start from the
value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is
smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the variable
is larger. The value itself we will mark with brackets, either $)$ or $($ for less
than or greater than respectively, and $]$ or $[$ for less than or equal to or greater
than or equal to respectively.</p>
<p>Once the graph is drawn we can quickly convert the graph into what is called
interval notation. Interval notation gives two numbers, the first is the smallest
value, the second is the largest value. If there is no largest value, we can use $8$
(infinity). If there is no smallest value, we can use $- 8$ negative infinity. If we
use either positive or negative infinity we will always use a curved bracket for that
value.</p>


<p><b>Example 6a-1:</b></p>

<p>Graph the inequality and give the interval notation</p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$x<2$</td>
    <td>Start at $2$ and shade below<br/>
Use ) for less than</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>OurGraph</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$(-8, 2)$</td>
    <td>Interval Notation</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p><b>Example 6a-2:</b></p>

<p>Graph the inequality and give the interval notation</p>



<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>y >$-1$</td>
    <td>Start at $-1$ and shade above<br/>
Use $[$ for greater than or equal</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>OurGraph</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$[-1,8)$</td>
    <td>Interval Notation</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>We can also take a graph and find the inequality for it.</p>


<p><b>Example 6a-3:</b></p>



<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Give the inequality for the graph:</td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Graph starts at $3$ and goes up or greater.</td>
    <td>Curved bracket means just greater than</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$x>3$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p><b>Example 6a-4:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Give the inequality for the graph:</td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Graph starts at $- 4$ and goes down or less.</td>
    <td>Square bracket means less than or
equal to</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$x6-4$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>Generally when we are graphing and giving interval notation for an inequality we
will have to first solve the inequality for our variable. Solving inequalities is very
similar to solving equations with one exception. Consider the following inequality
and what happens when various operations are done to it. Notice what happens
to the inequality sign as we add, subtract, multiply and divide by both positive
and negative numbers to keep the statment a true statement.</p>




<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$5>1$</td>
    <td>Add $3$ to both sides</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$8>4$</td>
    <td>Subtract $2$ fromboth sides</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$6>2$</td>
    <td>Multiply both sides by $3$</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$12>6$</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by $2$</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$6>3$</td>
    <td>Add $-1$ to both sides</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$5>2$</td>
    <td>Subtract $-4$ fromboth sides</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$9>6$</td>
    <td>Multiply both sides by $-2$</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-18<-12$</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by $-6$</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$3>2$</td>
    <td>Symbol flipped when we multiply or divide by a negative!</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>As the above problem illustrates, we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide on
both sides of the inequality. But if we multiply or divide by a negative number,
the symbol will need to flip directions. We will keep that in mind as we solve
inequalities.</p>


<p><b>Example 6a-4:</b></p>


<p>Solve and give interval notation</p>




<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$5-2x>11$</td>
    <td>Subtract $5$ fromboth sides</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$-5 -5$</td>
    <td></td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$-2x>6$</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by $-2$</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$-2 -2$</td>
    <td>Divide by a negative-flip symbol!</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$x6-3$</td>
    <td>Graph, starting at $-3$, going downwith $]$ for less than or equal to</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$(-8,-3]$</td>
    <td>Interval Notation</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>The inequality we solve can get as complex as the linear equations we solved. We
will use all the same patterns to solve these inequalities as we did for solving
equations. Just remember that any time we multiply or divide by a negative the
symbol switches directions (multiplying or dividing by a positive does not change
the symbol!)</p>


<p><b>Example $6a-5$:</b></p>

<p>Solve and give interval notation</p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$3(2x-4)+4x<4(3x-7)+8$</td>
    <td>Distribute</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$6x-12+4x<12x-28+8$</td>
    <td>Combine like terms</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$10x-12<12x -20$</td>
    <td>Move variable to one side</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-10x -10x$</td>
    <td>Subtract $10x$ fromboth sides</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-12<2x -20$</td>
    <td>Add $20$ to both sides</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$+20 +20$</td>
    <td></td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$8<2x$</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by $2$</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$2 2$</td>
    <td></td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$4<x$</td>
    <td>Be carefulwith graph, $x$ is larger!</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$(4,8)$</td>
    <td>Interval Notation</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>It is important to be careful when the inequality is written backwards as in the
previous example ($4 < x$ rather than $x > 4$). Often students draw their graphs the
wrong way when this is the case. The inequality symbol opens to the variable,
this means the variable is greater than $4$. So we must shade above the $4$.</p>
