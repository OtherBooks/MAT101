<b>Compound Inequalities</b>

<p><b>Inequalities - Compound Inequalities</b></p>


<p>Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation to the solution of
compound inequalities.</p>
<p>Several inequalities can be combined together to form what are called compound
inequalities. There are three types of compound inequalities which we will investigate
in this lesson.</p>
<p>The first type of a compound inequality is an OR inequality. For this type of
inequality we want a true statment from either one inequality OR the other
inequality OR both. When we are graphing these type of inequalities we will
graph each individual inequality above the number line, then move them both
down together onto the actual number line for our graph that combines them
together.</p>
<p>When we give interval notation for our solution, if there are two different parts to
the graph we will put a ? (union) symbol between two sets of interval notation,
one for each part.</p>

<p><b>Example 6b-1:</b></p>

<p>Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and give interval notation of solution</p>



<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$2x-5>3$ or $4-x>6$</td>
    <td>Solve each inequality</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$+5+5 -4 -4$</td>
    <td>Add or subtract first</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$2x>8 or -x>2$</td>
    <td>Divide</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$2 2 -1 -1$</td>
    <td>Dividing by negative flips sign</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$x>4$ or $x6-2$</td>
    <td>Graph the inequalities separatly above number line</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$(-8,-2]?(4,8)$</td>
    <td>Interval Notation</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>World View Note: The symbol for infinity was first used by the Romans,
although at the time the number was used for 1000. The greeks also used the
symbol for 10,000.</p>
<p>There are several different results that could result from an OR statement. The
graphs could be pointing different directions, as in the graph above, or pointing in
the same direction as in the graph below on the left, or pointing opposite directions,
but overlapping as in the graph below on the right. Notice how interval
notation works for each of these cases.</p>




<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As the graphs overlap, we take the
largest graph for our solution.</td>
    <td>When the graphs are combined they
cover the entire number line.</td> 
   
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Interval Notation: $(-8, 1)$</td>
    <td>Interval Notation: $(-8,8)$ or $R$</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>The second type of compound inequality is an AND inequality. AND inequalities
require both statements to be true. If one is false, they both are false. When we
graph these inequalities we can follow a similar process, first graph both inequalities
above the number line, but this time only where they overlap will be drawn
onto the number line for our final graph. When our solution is given in interval
notation it will be expressed in a manner very similar to single inequalities (there
is a symbol that can be used for AND, the intersection $- n$ , but we will not use it
here).</p>


<p><b>Example 6b-2:</b></p>

<p>Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and express it interval notation.</p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$2x+8>5x-7$ and $5x-3>3x+1$</td>
    <td>Move variables to one side</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$-2x -2x -3x -3x$</td>
    <td></td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$8>3x-7$ and $2x-3>1$</td>
    <td>Add $7$ or $3$ to both sides</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$+7 +7 +3+3$</td>
    <td></td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$15>3x$ and $2x>4$</td>
    <td>Divide</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$3 3 2 2$</td>
    <td></td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$5>x$ and $x>2$</td>
    <td>Graph, $x$ is smaller (or equal) than $5$,
greater than $2$</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$(2, 5]$</td>
    <td>Interval Notation</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>Again, as we graph AND inequalities, only the overlapping parts of the individual
graphs makes it to the final number line. As we graph AND inequalities there are
also three different types of results we could get. The first is shown in the above example. The second is if the arrows both point the same way, this is shown
below on the left. The third is if the arrows point opposite ways but don’t
overlap, this is shown below on the right. Notice how interval notation is
expressed in each case.</p>



<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>GRAPH</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this graph, the overlap is only the
smaller graph, so this is what makes it
to the final number line.</td>
    <td>In this graph there is no overlap of the
parts. Because their is no overlap, no
values make it to the final number
line.</td> 
   
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Interval Notation: $(-8,-2)$</td>
    <td>Interval Notation: No Solution or $?$</td> 
   
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>The third type of compound inequality is a special type of AND inequality. When
our variable (or expression containing the variable) is between two numbers, we
can write it as a single math sentence with three parts, such as $5 < x 6 8$, to show
x is between $5$ and $8$ (or equal to $8$). When solving these type of inequalities,
because there are three parts to work with, to stay balanced we will do the same
thing to all three parts (rather than just both sides) to isolate the variable in the
middle. The graph then is simply the values between the numbers with appropriate
brackets on the ends.

<p>Solve the inequality, graph the solution, and give interval notation.</p>

<table class = "center">

    <td>$-66-4x+2<2$</td>
    <td>Subtract $2$ fromall three parts</td> 
    
  </tr>

    <td>$-2 -2-2$</td>
    <td></td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-86-4x<0$</td>
    <td>Divide all three parts by $-4$</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$-4 -4 -4$</td>
    <td>Dividing by a negative flips the symbols</td> 
   
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>$2>x>0$</td>
    <td>Flip entire statement so values get larger left to right</td> 
   
  </tr>

    <td>Graph $x$ between $0$ and $2$</td>
