<p><b>Polynomials - Exponent Properties</b></p>

<p>Objective: Simplify expressions using the properties of exponents.</p>
<p>Problems with expoenents can often be simplified using a few basic exponent
properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to
discover the important properties.</p>
<p>World View Note: The word exponent comes from the Latin “expo” meaning
out of and “ponere” meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the
Babylonians living in Iraq were the first to do work with exponents (dating back
to the 23rd century BC or earlier!)</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-1:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>a3a2</td>
    <td>Expand exponents to multiplication problem</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$(aaa)(aa)$</td>
    <td>Now we have $5a$'s being multiplied together</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$a5$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>A quicker method to arrive at our answer would have been to just add the exponents:

$a3a2=a3+2=a5$ This is known as the product rule of exponents
</p>

<p>ProductRule of Exponents: $aman=am+n$
</p>

<p>The product rule of exponents can be used to simplify many problems. We will
add the exponent on like variables. This is shown in the following examples
</p>

<p><b>Example $4a-2$:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$32 · 36 · 3$</td>
    <td>Same base, add the exponents $2+6+1$</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$39$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p><b>Example $4a-3:$</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$2x3y5z · 5xy2z3$</td>
    <td>Multiply $2 · 5$, add exponents on $x$, $y$ and $z$</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10x4y7z4</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>Rather than multiplying, we will now try to divide with exponents</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-4:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>a5
a2</td>
    <td>Expand exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>aaaaa
aa</td>
    <td>Divide out two of the a's</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>aaa</td>
    <td>Convert to exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a3</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to just subtract the
exponents, a5
a2 =a5-2=a3. This is known as the quotient rule of exponents.</p>
<p>Quotient Rule of Exponents:
am
an =am-n</p>
<p>The quotient rule of exponents can similarly be used to simplify exponent problems
by subtracting exponents on like variables. This is shown in the following
examples.</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-5:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>713
75</td>
    <td>Same base, subtract the exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>78</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-6:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>5a3b5c2
2ab3c</td>
    <td>Subtract exponents on a, b and c</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5
2
a2b2c</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>A third property we will look at will have an exponent problem raised to a second
exponent. This is investigated in the following example.</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-7:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>??
a2
3</td>
    <td>Thismeanswe have a2 three times</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a2 · a2 · a2</td>
    <td>Add exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a6</td>
    <td>Our solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to just multiply the
exponents, (a2)3 = a2·3 = a6. This is known as the power of a power rule of exponents.
</p>

<p>Power of aPowerRule of Exponents: (am)n=amn
</p>

<p>This property is often combined with two other properties which we will investigate
now.
</p>


<p><b>Example 4a-8:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>(ab)3</td>
    <td>Thismeanswe have (ab) three times</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(ab)(ab)(ab)</td>
    <td>Three a's and three b's can bewrittenwith exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>a3b3</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to take the exponent
of three and put it on each factor in parenthesis, (ab)3 = a3b3. This is known as
the power of a product rule or exponents.</p>
<p>Power of aProductRule of Exponents: (ab)m=ambm</p>
<p>It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multiplication
inside parenthesis. This property does NOT work if there is addition or
subtraction.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b></p>

<p>(a+b)m=/=am+bm These areNOTequal, beware of this error!</p>

<p>Another property that is very similar to the power of a product rule is considered
next.</p>
<p><b>Example 4a-9:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td> a
b
3</td>
    <td>Thismeanswe have the fraction three timse</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a

 a
b</td>
    <td>Multiply fractions across the top and bottom, using exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>a3
b3</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to put the exponent
on every factor in both the numerator and denominator,
?? a
b
3
= a3
b3 . This is known
as the power of a quotient rule of exponents.</p>

<p>Power of aQuotientRule of Exponents:
 a
b
m
=
am
bm</p>

<p>The power of a power, product and quotient rules are often used together to simplify
expressions. This is shown in the following examples.</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-10:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>(x3yz2)4</td>
    <td>Put the exponent of 4 on each factor,multiplying powers</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x12y4z8</td>
    <td>Our solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
a3b
c8d5
2</td>
    <td>Put the exponent of 2 on each factor,multiplying powers</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a6b2
c8d10</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>As we multiply exponents its important to remember these properties apply to
exponents, not bases. An expressions such as 53 does not mean we multipy 5 by 3,
rather we multiply 5 three times, 5 × 5 × 5 = 125. This is shown in the next
example.</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-11:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>(4x2y5)3</td>
    <td>Put the exponent of 3 on each factor,multiplying powers</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>43x6y15</td>
    <td>Evaluate 43</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>64x6y15</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>In the previous example we did not put the 3 on the 4 and multipy to get 12, this
would have been incorrect. Never multipy a base by the exponent. These properties
pertain to exponents only, not bases.
</p>

<p>In this lesson we have discussed 5 different exponent properties. These rules are
summarized in the following table.
</p>

<p>Rules of Exponents

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>ProductRule of Exponents</td>
    <td>aman=am+n</td>

<p>These five properties are often mixed up in the same problem. Often there is a bit
of flexibility as to which property is used first. However, order of operations still
applies to a problem. For this reason it is the suggestion of the auther to simplify
inside any parenthesis first, then simplify any exponents (using power rules), and
finally simplify any multiplication or division (using product and quotient rules).
This is illustrated in the next few examples.
</p>

<p>Polynomials - Negative Exponents</p>

<p>Objective: Simplify expressions with negative exponents using the
properties of exponents.</p>
<p>There are a few special exponent properties that deal with exponents that are not
positive. The first is considered in the following example, which is worded out 2
different ways:</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-17:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>a3
a3</td>
    <td>Use the quotient rule to subtract exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a0</td>
    <td>Our Solution, but nowwe consider the problema the secondway:</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>a3
a3</td>
    <td>Rewrite exponents as repeatedmultiplication</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>aaa
aaa</td>
    <td>Reduce out all the a's</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>1
1
=1</td>
    <td>Our Solution,whenwe combine the two solutionswe get:</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>a0=1</td>
    <td>Our final result.</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>This final result is an imporant property known as the zero power rule of exponents</p>

<p>ZeroPowerRule of Exponents: a0=1</p>
<p>Any number or expression raised to the zero power will always be 1. This is illustrated
in the following example.</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-18:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>(3x2)0</td>
    <td>Zero power rule</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>Another property we will consider here deals with negative exponents. Again we
will solve the following example two ways.</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-19:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>a3
a5</td>
    <td>Using the quotient rule, subtract exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a-2</td>
    <td>Our Solution, butwewill also solve this problemanotherway.</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a3
a5</td>
    <td>Rewrite exponents as repeatedmultiplication</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>aaa
aaaaa</td>
    <td>Reduce three a's out of top and bottom</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1
aa</td>
    <td>Simplify to exponents</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1
a2</td>
    <td>Our Solution, putting these solutions together gives:</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a-2=
1
a2</td>
    <td>Our Final Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>This example illustrates an important property of exponents. Negative exponents
yield the reciprocal of the base. Once we take the reciprical the exponent is now
positive. Also, it is important to note a negative exponent does not mean the
expression is negative, only that we need the reciprocal of the base. Following are
the rules of negative exponents
</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Rules ofNegative Exponets:</td>
    <td>a-m=
1
m<br/><br/>1
a-m =am<br/><br/> a
b
-m
=
bm
am</td> 
    
  </tr>

</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>Negative exponents can be combined in several different ways. As a general rule if
we think of our expression as a fraction, negative exponents in the numerator
must be moved to the denominator, likewise, negative exponents in the denominator
need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exponent moves,
the exponent is now positive. This is illustrated in the following example.
</p>


<p><b>Example 4a-20:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>a3b-2c
2d-1 e-4f2</td>
    <td>Negative exponents on b, d, and e need to flip</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a 3cde4
2b2f2</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>As we simplified our fraction we took special care to move the bases that had a
negative exponent, but the expression itself did not become negative because of
those exponents. Also, it is important to remember that exponents only effect
what they are attached to. The 2 in the denominator of the above example does
not have an exponent on it, so it does not move with the d.
</p>

<p>We now have the following nine properties of exponents. It is important that we
are very familiar with all of them.
</p>

<p>World View Note: Nicolas Chuquet, the French mathematician of the 15th century
wrote 121m¯ to indicate 12x-1. This was the first known use of the negative
exponent.</p>
<p>Simplifying with negative exponents is much the same as simplifying with positive
exponents. It is the advice of the author to keep the negative exponents until the
end of the problem and then move them around to their correct location (numerator
or denominator). As we do this it is important to be very careful of rules for
adding, subtracting, and multiplying with negatives. This is illustrated in the following
examples</p>

<p><b>Example 4a-21:</b></p>

<p><center>

<p>In the previous example it is important to point out that when we simplified 3-2
we moved the three to the denominator and the exponent became positive. We
did not make the number negative! Negative exponents never make the bases negative,
they simply mean we have to take the reciprocal of the base. One final
example with negative exponents is given here.</p>
