<p>Radicals - Square Roots</p>
<p>Objective: Simplify expressions with square roots.</p>
<p>Square roots are the most common type of radical used. A square root “unsquares”
a number. For example, because 52=25 we say the square root of 25 is 5.
The square root of 25 is written as v25.</p>
<p>World View Note: The radical sign, when first used was an R with a line
through the tail, similar to our perscription symbol today. The R came from the
latin, “radix”, which can be translated as “source” or “foundation”. It wasn’t until
the 1500s that our current symbol was first used in Germany (but even then it
was just a check mark with no bar over the numbers!</p>
<p>The following example gives several square roots:</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-1:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>v1 =1</td>
    <td>v121 =11</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>v4 =2</td>
    <td>v625 =25</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>v9 =3</td>
    <td>v-81 =Undefined</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>The final example, v-81 is currently undefined as negatives have no square root.
This is because if we square a positive or a negative, the answer will be positive.
Thus we can only take square roots of positive numbers. In another lesson we will
define a method we can use to work with and evaluate negative square roots, but
for now we will simply say they are undefined.</p>
<p>Not all numbers have a nice even square root. For example, if we found v8 on
our calculator, the answer would be 2.828427124746190097603377448419... and
even this number is a rounded approximation of the square root. To be as accurate
as possible, we will never use the calculator to find decimal approximations of
square roots. Instead we will express roots in simplest radical form. We will do
this using a property known as the product rule of radicals</p>

<p>ProductRule of SquareRoots: a · b v =va · b</p>

<p>We can use the product rule to simplify an expression such as v36 · 5 by spliting
it into two roots, v36 · v5, and simplifying the first root, 6v5. The trick in this process is being able to translate a problem like v180 into v36 · 5. There are several
ways this can be done. The most common and, with a bit of practice, the
fastest method, is to find perfect squares that divide evenly into the radicand, or
number under the radical. This is shown in the next example.


<p><b>Example 4b-2:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>v75</td>
    <td>75 is divisible by 25, a perfect square</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>v25 · 3</td>
    <td>Split into factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>v25 ·v3</td>
    <td>Product rule, take the square root of 25</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>5v3</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>If there is a coefficient in front of the radical to begin with, the problem merely
becomes a big multiplication problem.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-3:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>5v63</td>
    <td>63 is divisible by 9, a perfect square</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>5v9 · 7</td>
    <td>Split into factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>5v9 ·v7</td>
    <td>Product rule, take the square root of 9</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>5 · 3v7</td>
    <td>Multiply coefficients</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>15v7</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>As we simplify radicals using this method it is important to be sure our final
answer can be simplified no more.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-4:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>v72</td>
    <td>72 is divisible by 9, a perfect square</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>v9 · 8</td>
    <td>Split into factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>v9 ·v8</td>
    <td>Product rule, take the square root of 9</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3v8</td>
    <td>But 8 is also divisible by a perfect square, 4</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3v4 · 2</td>
    <td>Split into factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3v4 ·v2</td>
    <td>Product rule, take the square root of 4</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3 · 2v2</td>
    <td>Multiply</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>6v2</td>
    <td>Our Solution.</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>The previous example could have been done in fewer steps if we had noticed that
72=36 · 2, but often the time it takes to discover the larger perfect square is more
than it would take to simplify in several steps.
Variables often are part of the radicand as well. When taking the square roots of
variables, we can divide the exponent by 2. For example, vx8 = x4, because we
divide the exponent of 8 by 2. This follows from the power of a power rule of
expoennts, (x4)2 = x8. When squaring, we multiply the exponent by two, so when
taking a square root we divide the exponent by 2. This is shown in the following
example.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-5:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>-5 18x4y6z10</td>
    <td>18 is divisible by 9, a perfect square</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-5 9 · 2x4y6z10</td>
    <td>Split into factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-5v9 ·v2 · x4 v
· y6
p
· z10</td>
    <td>Product rule, simplify roots, divide exponents by 2</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-5 · 3x2y3z5v2</td>
    <td>Multiply coefficients</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-15x2y3z5v2</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>We can’t always evenly divide the exponent on a variable by 2. Sometimes we
have a remainder. If there is a remainder, this means the remainder is left inside
the radical, and the whole number part is how many are outside the radical. This
is shown in the following example.
</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-6:</b></p>



<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>v20x5y9z6</td>
    <td>20 is divisible by 4, a perfect square</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>v4 · 5x5y9z6</td>
    <td>Split into factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
<tr>
    <td>v4 ·v5 ·vx5

    <td>Simplify, divide exponents by 2, remainder is left inside</td> 
    
  </tr>

    <td>2x2y4z3v5xy</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>

</p>


<p><b>Radicals - Higher Roots</b></p>
<p>Objective: Simplify radicals with an index greater than two.</p>
<p>While square roots are the most common type of radical we work with, we can
take higher roots of numbers as well: cube roots, fourth roots, fifth roots, etc. Following
is a definition of radicals.</p>
<p>mva =b if bm=a</p>
<p>The small letter m inside the radical is called the index. It tells us which root we
are taking, or which power we are “un-doing”. For square roots the index is 2. As
this is the most common root, the two is not usually written.</p>
<p>World View Note: The word for root comes from the French mathematician
Franciscus Vieta in the late 16th century.</p>
<p>The following example includes several higher roots.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-7:</b></p>







<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>125 3v =5</td>
    <td>-64 3v =-4</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>81 4v =3</td>
    <td>-128 7v =-2</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>32 5v =2</td>
    <td>-16 4v =undefined</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>We must be careful of a few things as we work with higher roots. First its important
not to forget to check the index on the root. v81 = 9 but 81 4v = 3. This is
because 92 = 81 and 34 = 81. Another thing to watch out for is negatives under
roots. We can take an odd root of a negative number, because a negative number
raised to an odd power is still negative. However, we cannot take an even root of
a negative number, this we will say is undefined. In a later section we will discuss
how to work with roots of negative, but for now we will simply say they are undefined.</p>
<p>We can simplify higher roots in much the same way we simplified square roots,
using the product property of radicals.</p>

<p>Product Property ofRadicals: ab mv =mva · b mv</p>
<p>Often we are not as familiar with higher powers as we are with squares. It is
important to remember what index we are working with as we try and work our
way to the solution.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-8:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>3v54</td>
    <td>We are working with a cubed root,want third powers</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>23=8</td>
    <td>Test 2, 23=8, 54 is not divisible by 8.</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>33=27</td>
    <td>Test 3, 33=27, 54 is divisible by 27!</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3v27 · 2</td>
    <td>Write as factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3 2 3v</td>
    <td>Product rule, take cubed root of 27</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-9:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>3 48 4v</td>
    <td>We areworkingwith a fourth root,want fourth powers</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>24=16</td>
    <td>Test 2, 24=16, 48 is divisible by 16!</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3 16 · 3 4v</td>
    <td>Write as factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3 16 4v · 3 4v</td>
    <td>Product rule, take fourth root of 16</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>3 · 2 3 4v</td>
    <td>Multiply coefficients</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>6 3 4v</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>We can also take higher roots of variables. As we do, we will divide the exponent
on the variable by the index. Any whole answer is how many of that varible will
come out of the square root. Any remainder is how many are left behind inside
the square root. This is shown in the following examples.
</p>


<p><b>Example 4b-10:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>5vx25y17z3</td>
    <td>Divide each exponent by 5,whole number outside, remainder inside</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>x5y3v5 y2z3</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>In the previous example, for the x, we divided 25
5 = 5R 0, so x5 came out, no x’s
remain inside. For the y, we divided 17
5 = 3R2, so y3 came out, and y2 remains
inside. For the z, when we divided 3
5 = 0R3, all three or z3 remained inside. The
following example includes integers in our problem.
</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-11:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>2 3v40a4b8</td>
    <td>Looking for cubes that divide into 40.The number 8 works!</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 3v8 · 5a4b8</td>
    <td>Take cube root of 8, dividing exponents on variables by 3</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 · 2ab2 3v5ab2</td>
    <td>Remainders are left in radical.Multiply coefficients</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4ab2 3v5ab2</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p><b>Radicals - Adding Radicals</b></p>

<p>Objective: Add like radicals by first simplifying each radical.</p>
<p>Adding and subtracting radicals is very similar to adding and subtracting with
variables. Consider the following example.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-12:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>5x+3x-2x</td>
    <td>Combine like terms</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>6x</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>5v11 +3v11 -2v11</td>
    <td>Combine like terms</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>6v11</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>Notice that when we combined the terms with v11 it was just like combining
terms with x. When adding and subtracting with radicals we can combine like
radicals just as like terms. We add and subtract the coefficients in front of the radical, and the radical stays the same. This is shown in the following example.
</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-13:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Combine like radicals 7 6 5v + 6 5v and 4 3 5v -8v3 5</td>
    <td>Smith</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7 6 5v +4 3 5v -9 3 5v + 6</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>We cannot simplify this expression any more as the radicals do not match. Often
problems we solve have no like radicals, however, if we simplify the radicals first
we may find we do in fact have like radicals.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-14:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>5v45 +6v18 -2v98 +v20</td>
    <td>Simplify radicals, find perfect square factors</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5v9 · 5 +6v9 · 2 -2v49 · 2 +v4 · 5</td>
    <td>Take rootswhere possible</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 · 3v5 +6 · 3v2 -2 · 7v2 +2v5</td>
    <td>Multiply coefficients</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>15v5 +18v2 -14v2 +2v5</td>
    <td>Combine like terms</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>17v5 +4v2</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>World View Note: The Arab writers of the 16th century used the symbol similar
to the greater than symbol with a dot underneath for radicals.
</p>
This exact process can be used to add and subtract radicals with higher indices
</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-15:</b></p>

<p><center>

    <td>-6 2 3v +5 9 3v</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>

</center>
</p>


<p>Radicals - Multiply and Divide Radicals
</p>

<p>Objective: Multiply and divide radicals using the product and quotient
rules of radicals.
</p>

<p>Multiplying radicals is very simple if the index on all the radicals match. The
prodcut rule of radicals which we have already been using can be generalized as
follows:
</p>

<p>ProductRule ofRadicals: a b mv · c d mv =ac bd mv
</p>

<p>Another way of stating this rule is we are allowed to multiply the factors outside
the radical and we are allowed to multiply the factors inside the radicals, as long
as the index matches. This is shown in the following example.
</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-16:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>-5v14 · 4v6</td>
    <td>Multiply outside and inside the radical</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>-20v84</td>
    <td>Simplify the radical, divisible by 4</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>-20v4 · 21</td>
    <td>Take the square rootwhere possible</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>-20 · 2v21</td>
    <td>Multiply coefficients</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>-40v21</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>The same process works with higher roots
</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-17:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>2 18 3v · 6 15 3v</td>
    <td>Multiply outside and inside the radical</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>12 270 3v</td>
    <td>Simplify the radical, divisible by 27</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>12 27 · 10 3v</td>
    <td>Take cube rootwhere possible</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>12 · 3 10 3v</td>
    <td>Multiply coefficients</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>36 10 3v</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>When multiplying with radicals we can still use the distributive property or FOIL
just as we could with variables.</p>

<p>As we are multiplying we always look at our final solution to check if all the radicals
are simplified and all like radicals or like terms have been combined.
Division with radicals is very similar to multiplication, if we think about division
as reducing fractions, we can reduce the coefficients outside the radicals and
reduce the values inside the radicals to get our final solution.

<p>There is one catch to dividing with radicals, it is considered bad practice to have
a radical in the denominator of our final answer. If there is a radical in the
denominator we will rationalize it, or clear out any radicals in the denominator.</p><p>We do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same thing.
The problems we will consider here will all have a monomial in the denominator.
The way we clear a monomial radical in the denominator is to focus on the index.
The index tells us how many of each factor we will need to clear the radical. For
example, if the index is 4, we will need 4 of each factor to clear the radical. This
is shown in the following examples.</p>

<p>The previous example could have been solved by multiplying numerator and
denominator by 3v252. However, this would have made the numbers very large
and we would have needed to reduce our soultion at the end. This is why rewriting
the radical as 3v52 and multiplying by just 5 3v was the better way to simplify.</p>
<p>We will also always want to reduce our fractions (inside and out of the radical)
before we rationalize.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-25:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>6v14
12v22</td>

<p><b>Radicals - Rational Exponents</b></p>
<p>Objective: Convert between radical notation and exponential notation
and simplify expressions with rational exponents using the properties
of exponents.</p>
<p>When we simplify radicals with exponents, we divide the exponent by the index.
Another way to write division is with a fraction bar. This idea is how we will
define rational exponents.</p>
<p>Definition ofRational Exponents: a
n
m =(mva)n</p>
<p>The denominator of a rational exponent becomes the index on our radical, likewise
the index on the radical becomes the denominator of the exponent. We can
use this property to change any radical expression into an exponential expression.</p>
<p><b>Example 4b-27:</b></p>
<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>( x 5v )3=x

    <td>( 3x 6v )5=(3x)

(3vxy)2 =(xy)-2

    <td>Negative exponents fromreciprocals</td>
  </tr>

</p>


<p>We can also change any rational exponent into a radical expression by using the
denominator as the index.
</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-27:</b></p>

<p>World View Note: Nicole Oresme, a Mathematician born in Normandy was the
first to use rational exponents. He used the notation 1
3•9p to represent 9
1
3. However
his notation went largely unnoticed.</p>
<p>The ability to change between exponential expressions and radical expressions
allows us to evaluate problems we had no means of evaluating before by changing
to a radical.</p>

<p><b>Example 4b-28:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

    <td>27-4

<p>The largest advantage of being able to change a radical expression into an exponential
expression is we are now allowed to use all our exponent properties to simplify.

<p>When adding and subtracting with fractions we need to be sure to have a
common denominator. When multiplying we only need to multiply the numerators
together and denominators together. The following examples show several
different problems, using different properties to simplify the rational exponents.

<p>It is important to remember that as we simplify with rational exponents we are
using the exact same properties we used when simplifying integer exponents. The
only difference is we need to follow our rules for fractions as well. It may be worth
reviewing your notes on exponent properties to be sure your comfortable with
using the properties.</p>
