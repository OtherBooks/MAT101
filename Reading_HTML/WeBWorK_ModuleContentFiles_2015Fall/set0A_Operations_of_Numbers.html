<h1>MAT-101: Module 0A Signed Numbers and Operations of Numbers</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add, subtract, multiply and divide positive and negative
    numbers.</li>
  <li> Evaluate expressions using the order of operations, including the use of absolute value.</li>
  <li> Simplify algebraic expressions by substituting given values, distributing, and combining like terms.</li>
</ul>
<h2> <b>Integers</b> </h2>
<p> The ability to work comfortably with negative numbers is essential to success in
  algebra. For this reason we will do a quick review of adding, subtracting, multiplying
  and dividing of integers. Integers are all the positive whole numbers, zero,
  and their opposites (negatives). As this is intended to be a review of integers, the
  descriptions and examples will not be as detailed as a normal lesson. </p>
<p> <b>World View Note:</b> The first set of rules for working with negative numbers was
  written out by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupa.</p>
<p> When adding integers we have two cases to consider. The first is if the signs
  match, both positive or both negative. If the signs match we will add the numbers
  together and keep the sign. This is illustrated in the following example: </p>
<h3><b>Example 0A-1:</b>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$-8$</td>
      <td>Our Solution</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
<p> If the signs don't match, one positive and one negative number, we will subtract
  the numbers (as if they were all positive) and then use the sign from the larger
  number. This means if the larger number is positive, the answer is positive. If the
  larger number is negative, the answer is negative. This is shown in the following
  examples: </p>

<p> For subtraction of negatives we will change the problem to an addition problem
  which we can then solve using the above methods. The way we change a subtraction
  to an addition is to add the opposite of the number after the subtraction
  sign. Often this method is referred to as "add the opposite." This is illustrated in
  the following examples. </p>

<p> Multiplication and division of integers both work in a very similar pattern. The
  short description of the process is we multiply and divide like normal, if the signs
  match (both positive or both negative) the answer is positive. If the signs don't
  match (one positive and one negative) then the answer is negative. This is shown
  in the following examples: </p>

<p>A few things to be careful of when working with integers. First be sure not to
  confuse a problem like $-3-8$ with $-3(-8)$. The second problem is a multiplication
  problem because there is nothing between the 3 and the parenthesis. If
  there is no operation written in between the parts, then we assume that means we
  are multiplying. The  $-3-8$ problem is subtraction because the subtraction separates
  the 3 from what comes after it. Another item to watch out for is to be
  careful not to mix up the pattern for adding and subtracting integers with the
  pattern for multiplying and dividing integers. They can look very similar, for
  example if the signs match on addition, the we keep the negative, $-3 + (-7) = -
  10$, but if the signs match on multiplication, the answer is positive, $(-3)(-7) =
  21$. </p>
<h2><b>Operations of Numbers</b></h2>
<p>  When simplifying expressions it is important that we simplify them in the correct order. Consider the following problem done two different ways: </p>
<h3> <b>Example 0A-14:</b> 
  <!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 24 pg 18--> 
  <br>
</h3>
<center>
  <table class = "center">
    <tr>
      <td>$\underbrace{2+5} · 3$</td>
      <td>Add First</td>
      <td>&nbsp&nbsp versus &nbsp&nbsp </td>
      <td>$2+\underbrace{5 · 3}$</td>
      <td>Multiply First</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$7 · 3$</td>
      <td>Multiply</td>
      <td>&nbsp&nbsp </td>
      <td>$2+ 15$</td>
      <td>Add</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$21$</td>
      <td>Solution</td>
      <td>&nbsp&nbsp </td>
      <td>$17$</td>
      <td>Solution</td>
    </tr>

The previous example illustrates that if the same problem is done two different ways we will arrive at two deifferent solutions. However, only one method can be correct. It turns out the secont method, 17, is the correct method. The order of operations ends with the most basic of operations, addition (or subtraction). Before addition is completed we must do repeated addition or multiplication (or division). Before multiplication is completed we must do repeated multiplication or exponents. When we want to do something out of order and make it come first we will put it in parenthesis (or grouping symbols). This list then is our order of operantons we will use to simplify expressions. </p><p>
<center>
  <b><u>Order of Operations:</u></p><p>
  Parenthesis (Grouping)</p><p>
  Exponents</p><p>
  Multiply and Divide (Left to Right)</p><p>
  Add and Subtract (Left to Right)</b></p><p>
</center>
Multiply and Divide are on the same level because they are the same operation (division is just multiplying by the reciprocal). This means they must be done left to right, so some problems we will divide first, others we will multiply first. The same is true for adding and subtracting (subtracting is just adding the opposite).
Often students use the word PEMDAS to remember the order of operations, as the first letter of each operation creates the word PEMDAS.  However, it is the authors suggestion to think about PEMDAS as a vertical word written as: <br>
<center>
  P <br>
  E <br>
  MD <br>
  AS<br>
</center>
<p>so we dont forget that multiplication and division are done left to right (same with addition and subtraction). Another way students remember the order of operations is to think of a phrase such as Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally where each word starts with the same letters as the order of operations start with.</p><p>
<b>World View Note:</b> The first use of grouping symbols are found in 1646 in the Dutch mathematician, Franciscus van Schooten's text, Vieta.  He used a bar over the expression that is to be evaluated first. So problems like $2(3 + 5)$ were written as $2\cdot \overline{3 + 5}$.</p>

It is very important to remember to multiply and divide from from left to right!</p>

  In the previous example, if we had multiplied first, five would have been  the answer which is incorrect.</p>
<p>If there are several parenthesis in a problem we will start with the inner most parenthesis and work our way out. Inside each parenthesis we simplify using the order of operations as well. To make it easier to know which parenthesis goes with which parenthesis, different types of parenthesis will be used such as { } and [ ] and ( ), these parenthesis all mean the same thing, they are parenthesis and must be evaluated first.</p>

As the above example illustrates, it can take several steps to complete a problem. The key to successfully solve order of operations problems is to take the time to show your work and do one step at a time. This will reduce the chance of making a mistake along the way. </p><p>
There are several types of grouping symbols that can be used besides parenthesis. One type is a fraction bar. If we have a fraction, the entire numerator and the entire denominator must be evaluated before we reduce the fraction. In these cases we can simplify in both the numerator and denominator at the same time. </p><p>
<b>Example 0A-18:</b> 
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 28 pg 20-->

      <td align="right">$\dfrac{\overbrace{2^4} - ( - 8) \cdot 3}{\underbrace{15 \div 5} - 1}$ </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$\dfrac{16 - \overbrace{( - 8) \cdot 3}}{\underbrace{3 - 1}}$ </td>

      <td>Our Solution</td>

  </table>
</center>
</p><p>
Another type of grouping symbol that also has an operation  with  it,  absolute value. When we have absolute value we will evaluate everything inside the absolute value, just as if it were a normal parenthesis. Then once the inside is completed we will take the absolute value, or distance from zero, to make the number positive.</p><p>

The above example also illustrates an important point about exponents. Exponents only are considered to be on the number they are attached to. This means when we see $- 4^2$, only the $4$ is squared, giving us $-(4^2)$ or $-16$. But when the negative is in parentheses, such as $(-5)^2$ the negative is part of the number and is also squared giving us a positive solution, $25$. </p><p>
In algebra we will often need to simplify an expression to make it easier to use.  There are three basic forms of simplifying which we will review here. </p><p>
<b>World View Note:</b> The term Algebra comes from the Arabic word al-jabr which means reunion. It was first used in Iraq in 830 AD by Mohammad ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi. </p>
<p> <b>Working with Variables</b> </p>
The first form of simplifying expressions is used when we know what number each
variable in the expression represents. If we know what they represent we can
replace each variable with the equivalent number and simplify what remains using
order of operations. </p><p>
<b>Example 0A-20:</b> 
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 30 pg 22--> 
<br>
<center>
  <table class = "center">
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$p(q +6)$ when $p=3$ and $q=5$</td>
      <td>Replace $p$ with $3$ and $q$ with $5$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$(3)((5)+6)$</td>
      <td>Evaluate parenthesis</td>

      <td>Our Solution</td>
    </tr>

</center>
</p><p>
Whenever a variable is replaced with something, we will put the new number
inside a set of parenthesis. Notice the $3$ and $5$ in the previous example are in
parenthesis. This is to preserve operations that are sometimes lost in a simple
replacement. Sometimes the parenthesis wont make a difference, but it is a good
habit to always use them to prevent problems later. </p><p>

It will be more common in our study of algebra that we do not know the value of
the variables. In this case, we will have to simplify what we can and leave the
variables in our final solution. One way we can simplify expressions is to combine
like terms. Like terms are terms where the variables match exactly (exponents
included). Examples of like terms would be $3xy$ and $-7xy$ or $3a^2b$ and $8a^2b$ or $-3$ and $5$. If we have like terms we are allowed to add (or subtract) the numbers in
front of the variables, then keep the variables the same. This is shown in the following
examples: </p><p>

As we combine like terms we need to interpret subtraction signs as part of the following
term. This means if we see a subtraction sign, we treat the following term
like a negative term, the sign always stays with the term. </p><p>
A final method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with problems
there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem difficult, if not
impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive
property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis
by each term inside of the parenthesis. </p><p>
<center>
  <b>Distributive Property:</b> $a(b+c)=ab+ac$
</center>
</p><p>
Several examples of using the distributive property are given below. </p><p>
<b>Example 0A-24:</b> 
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 34 pg 23--> 
<br>
<center>
  <table class = "center">
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$4(2x-7)$</td>
      <td>Multiply each term by $4$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$8x-28$</td>
      <td>Our Solution</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
</p><p>
<b>Example 0A-25:</b> 
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 35 pg 23--> 
<br>
<center>
  <table class = "center">
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$-7(5x-6)$</td>
      <td>Multiply each term by $-7$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$-35x+42$</td>
      <td>Our Solution</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
</p><p>
In the previous example we again use the fact that the sign goes with the number.
This means we treat the $-6$ as a negative number, this gives $(-7)(-6) = 42$, a
positive number. The most common error in distributing is a sign error, <b>be very
careful with your signs!</b> </p><p>
It is possible to distribute just a negative through parenthesis. If we have a negative
in front of parenthesis we can think of it like a $-1$ in front and distribute the
$-1$ through. This is shown in the following example. </p><p>
<b>Example 0A-26:</b> 
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 36 pg 24--> 
<br>
<center>
  <table class = "center">
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$-(4x-5y +6)$</td>
      <td>Negative can be thought of as $-1$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$-1(4x-5y +6)$</td>
      <td>Multiply each term by $-1$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$-4x+5y -6$</td>
      <td>Our Solution</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
</p><p>
Distributing through parenthesis and combining like terms can be combined into
one problem. Order of operations tells us to multiply (distribute) first then add or
subtract last (combine like terms). Thus we do each problem in two steps, distribute
then combine. </p><p>
<b>Example 0A-27:</b> 
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 37 pg 24--> 
<br>
<center>
  <table class = "center">
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$5+3(2x-4)$</td>
      <td>Distribute $3$, multiplying each term</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$5+6x-12$</td>
      <td>Combine like terms $5-12$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$-7+6x$</td>
      <td>Our Solution</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
</p><p>
<b>Example 0A-28:</b> 
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 38 pg 24--> 
<br>
<center>
  <table class = "center">
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$3x-2(4x-5)$</td>
      <td>Distribute $-2$, multiplying each term</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$3x-8x+10$</td>
      <td>Combine like terms $3x-8x$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right">$-5x+10$</td>
      <td>Our Solution</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
</p><p>
In the previous example we distributed $-2$, not just $2$. This is because we will
always treat subtraction like a negative sign that goes with the number after it.
This makes a big difference when we multiply by the $-5$ inside the parenthesis,
we now have a positive answer. Following are more involved examples of distributing
and combining like terms. </p><p>
