<b>MAT-101: Module 2B Lines</b>
</p>


<b>Objectives:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the slope and $y$-intercept of a line given a graph or two points.</li>
  <li>Determine if a line rises, falls, or is horizontal based on its slope.</li>
  <li>Determine the slope-intercept form of a linear equation.</li>
  <li>Compare relative steepness of lines of varying slopes.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Slope</b></p>

<p>As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify different properties of the
lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope
is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25, is very steep. A
line with a small slope, such as $\frac{1}{10}$ is very flat. We will also use slope to describe
the direction of the line. A line that rises from left to right will have a positive
slope and a line that falls from left to right will have a negative slope. A horizontal line will have zero slope.
As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to
how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction $\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$.</p>

<p>Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the $y$-values. Run would be a horizontal
change, or a change in the $x$-values. So another way to describe slope
would be the fraction $\frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}$ . It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw
vertical and horizontal lines from one point to another to make what is called a
slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope. The following
examples show graphs that we find the slope of using this idea.</p>

<b>Example 2B-1:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 123 pg 95-->
<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set2B_Lines_Ex_01.png"></td>
    <td>To find the slope of this line we will
consider the rise, or vertical change,
and the run, or horizontal change.
Drawing these lines in makes a slope
triangle that we can use to count from
one point to the next. The graph goes
down 4, right 6. This is rise - 4, run
6. As a fraction it would be $\frac{-4}{6}$.
Reduce the fraction to get $\frac{-2}{3}$. The slope is negative indicating this line falls.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Slope = $-\frac{2}{3}$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table> </p>

<p><b>World View Note</b>: When French mathematicians Ren&eacute Descartes and Pierre de
Fermat first developed the coordinate plane and the idea of graphing lines (and
other functions) the $y$-axis was not a vertical line!</p>

<p><b>Example 2B-2:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 124 pg 96-->
<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set2B_Lines_Ex_02.png"></td>
    <td>To find the slope of this line, the rise
is up 6, the run is right 3. Our slope is
then written as a fraction, $\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$ or $\frac{6}{3}$.
This fraction reduces to 2. This will
be our positive slope, indicating this line rises.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Slope $= 2$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table> </p>

<p>There are two special lines that have unique slopes that we need to be aware of.
They are illustrated in the following example.</p>

<p><b>Example 2B-3:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 125 pg 96-->
<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set2B_Lines_Ex_03a.png"></td>
    <td><img src="set2B_Lines_Ex_03b.png"></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">In this graph there is no rise, but the
run is 3 units. This slope becomes $\frac{0}{3}=0$. This line,
and all horizontal lines have a zero slope.</td>
    <td>This line has a rise of 5, but no run.
The slope becomes  $\frac{5}{0}=$
undefined. This line,
and all vertical lines, have no slope.</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no
slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first
slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The
second slope can't get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large
enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.</p>

<p>We can find the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a
graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in $y$ values,
we can calculate this by subtracting the $y$ values of a point. Similarly, if run is a
change in the $x$ values, we can calculate this by subtracting the $x$ values of a
point. In this way we get the following equation for slope:</p>

<p><b>The slope of a line through $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$
</b></p>

<p>When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope.
For this reason we often represent the slope with the variable $m$. Now we have
the following for slope:</p>

<p><b>Slope $=m=\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\dfrac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in }x}
=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$</b></p>

<p>As we subtract the $y$ values and the $x$ values when calculating slope it is important
we subtract them in the same order. This process is shown in the following
examples.</p>

<p><b>Example 2B-4:</b> Find the slope and describe the line.

</p>

<p>
Again, there is a big difference between no slope and a zero slope. Zero is an
integer and it has a value, the slope of a flat horizontal line. No slope has no
value, it is undefined, the slope of a vertical line.

Using the slope formula we can also find missing points if we know what the slope
is. This is shown in the following two examples:
</p>

<p><b>Lines - Slope-Intercept Form</b></p>

<p>When graphing a line we found one method we could use is to make a table of
values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to
make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is finding the slope and
the $y$-intercept of the equation. The slope can be represented by $m$ and the $y$-intercept,
where it crosses the vertical axis and $x = 0$, can be represented by $(0, b)$ where $b$
is the value where the graph crosses the vertical $y$-axis. Any other point on the
line can be represented by $(x, y)$. Using this information we will look at the slope
formula and solve the formula for $y$.</p>


<p><b>Example 2B-8:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 132 pg 102-->

<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$m, (0,b), (x,y)$</td>
    <td>Using the slope formula $\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=m$ gives:</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right"> $\dfrac{y-b}{x-0}=m$</td>
    <td>Simplify</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\dfrac{y-b}{x}=m$</td>
    <td>Multiply both sides by $x$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$y-b=mx$</td>
    <td>Add $b$ to both sides</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\underline{+b\hphantom{12}+b}$</td>
    <td>$\,$</td>

  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td align="right">$y=mx+b$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
This equation, $y =mx + b$ can be thought of as the equation of any line that has a
slope of $m$ and a $y$-intercept of $b$. This formula is known as the slope-intercept
equation.
</p>

<center><p><b>Slope-Intercept Equation: $y =mx+b$</b></p></center>

<p>If we know the slope and the $y$-intercept we can easily find the equation that represents the line.</p>

<p><b>Example 2B-9:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 133 pg 102-->
<br>

<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right">Slope $=\dfrac{3}{4}$, $y$-intercept $=-3$</td>
    <td>Use the slope-intercept equation</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right"> $y =mx+b$</td>
    <td>$m$ is the slope, $b$ is the $y$-intercept</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$y=\dfrac{3}{4}x-3$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
We can also find the equation by looking at a graph and finding the slope and $y$-intercept.
</p>

<p><b>Example 2B-10:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 134 pg 103-->

<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set2B_Lines_Ex_10.png"></td>
    <td>Identify the point where the graph
crosses the $y$-axis $(0,3)$. This means
the $y$-intercept is 3.</br></br>Identify one other point and draw a
slope triangle to find the slope. The
slope is $-\frac{2}{3}$</br></br>$y =mx+b$ Slope-intercept equation</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right"> $y =-\dfrac{2}{3}x+3$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>We can also move in the opposite direction, using the equation to identify the slope
and $y$-intercept and graph the equation from this information. However, it will be
important for the equation to first be in slope-intercept form. If it is not, we will
have to solve it for $y$ so we can identify the slope and the $y$-intercept.</p>

<p><b>Example 2B-11:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 135 pg 103-->

<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right">Write in slope-intercept form: $2x-4y =6$</td>
    <td>Solve for $y$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right"> $\underline{-2x\hphantom{123}-2x}$</td>
    <td>Subtract $2x$ from both sides</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$-4y =-2x+6$</td>

    <td>Put $x$ term first</td>

  </tr>
   <tr>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Once we have an equation in slope-intercept form we can graph it by first plotting
the $y$-intercept, then using the slope, find a second point and connecting the dots.</p>

Nicole Oresme, in 1323 suggested graphing lines that would look more like a bar graph with a constant slope!</p>

 </p>

<p>We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to find the next point with
using a coordinate such as $(4, -2)$ to find an individual point. Coordinates such as
$(4, -2)$ start from the origin $(0,0)$ and move horizontally first, and vertically second.
Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The
numerator is the vertical change and the denominator is the horizontal change.</p>

<p>Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very different. Zero
slope, corresponding to a horizontal line, will simply have a slope of zero which when multiplied
by $x$ gives zero in the equation. So the equation simply becomes $y = b$ or $y$ is equal to the $y$-intercept
of the graph. If we have no slope (or undefined slope), or a vertical line, the equation can't be
written in slope-intercept form at all because the slope is undefined. There is no $y$ in
these equations. We will simply make $x$ equal to the $x$-intercept of the graph.</p>

<p><b>Lines - Point-Slope Form</b></p>

<p>
The slope-intercept form has the advantage of being simple to remember and use.
However, it has one major disadvantage: we must know the $y$-intercept in order to
use it! Generally we do not know the $y$-intercept, we only know one or more
points on the line (that are not the $y$-intercept). In these cases we can't use the slope-intercept
equation, so we will use a different more flexible formula. If we let the slope
of an equation be $m$, and a specific point on the line be $(x_1, y_1)$, and any other
point on the line be $(x, y)$, we can use the slope formula to make a second equation.

If we know the slope, $m$, of an equation and any point on the line $(x_1, y_1)$ we can
easily plug these values into the equation above which will be called the point-slope
formula.</p>

<p>Write the equation of the line through the point $(3,-4)$ with a slope of $\dfrac{3}{5}$.</p>

    <td align="right">$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$</td>
    <td>Plug values into point-slope formula</td>

    <td align="right"> $y-(-4)=\dfrac{3}{5}(x-3)$</td>

Often, we will prefer final answers be written in slope-intercept form. If the directions ask for the answer in slope-intercept form we will simply distribute the
slope, then solve for $y$.
