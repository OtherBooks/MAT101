<p><b>Graphing - Slope-Intercept Form</b></p>

<p>Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and y-intercept.</p>
<p>When graphing a line we found one method we could use is to make a table of
values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to
make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is finding the slope and
the y-intercept of the equation. The slope can be represented by m and the yintercept,
where it crosses the axis and x = 0, can be represented by (0, b) where b
is the value where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis. Any other point on the
line can be represented by (x, y). Using this information we will look at the slope
formula and solve the formula for y.</p>


<br><br>


<b>Example 3b-1:</b> 
<br>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>m, (0, b), (x, y)</td>
    <td>Using the slope formula gives:</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>y -b
x-0
=m</td>
    <td>Simplify</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>y -b
x
=m</td>
    <td>Multiply both sides by x</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>y -b=mx</td>
    <td>Add b to both sides</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>+b +b</td>
    <td></td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>y =mx+b</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>This equation, y =mx + b can be thought of as the equation of any line that as a
slope of m and a y-intercept of b. This formula is known as the slope-intercept
equation.</p>
<p>Slope-Intercept Equation: y =mx+b</p>
<p>If we know the slope and the y-intercept we can easily find the equation that represents
the line.</p>

<p><b>Example 3b-2:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Slope=
3
4
, y -intercept=-3</td>
    <td>Use the slope-intercept equation</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>y =mx+b</td>
    <td>mis the slope, b is the y -intercept</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>y =
3
4
x-3</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>We can also find the equation by looking at a graph and finding the slope and y intercept.</p>


<p><b>Example 3b-3:</b></p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>Identify the point where the graph
crosses the y-axis (0,3). This means
the y-intercept is 3.</br></br>Idenfity one other point and draw a
slope triangle to find the slope. The
slope is - 2
3</br></br>y =mx+b Slope-intercept equation</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>y =-
2
3
x+3</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>We can also move the opposite direction, using the equation identify the slope
and y-intercept and graph the equation from this information. However, it will be
important for the equation to first be in slope intercept form. If it is not, we will
have to solve it for y so we can identify the slope and the y-intercept.</p>

<p><b>Example 3b-4:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Write in slope-intercept form: 2x-4y =6</td>
    <td>Solve for y</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-2x -2x</td>
    <td>Subtract 2x fromboth sides</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>-4y =-2x+6</td>
    <td>Put x termfirst</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>-4 -4 -4</td>
    <td>Divide each termby-4</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>y =
1
2
x-
3
2</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>Once we have an equation in slope-intercept form we can graph it by first plotting
the y-intercept, then using the slope, find a second point and connecting the dots.</p>

<p><b>Example 3b-5:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Graph y =
1
2
x-4</td>
    <td>Recall the slope-intercept formula</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>y =mx+b</td>
    <td>Idenfity the slope,m, and the y -intercept, b</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>m=
1
2
, b=-4</td>
    <td>Make the graph</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>Starting with a point at the y-intercept
of -4,</br></br>Then use the slope rise
run, so we will rise
1 unit and run 2 units to find the next
point.</br></br>Once we have both points, connect the
dots to get our graph.</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>World View Note: Before our current system of graphing, French Mathematician
Nicole Oresme, in 1323 sugggested graphing lines that would look more like a bar graph with a constant slope!</p>


<p><b>Example 3b-6:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Graph 3x+4y =12</td>
    <td>Not in slope intercept form</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-3x -3x</td>
    <td>Subtract 3x fromboth sides</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>4y =-3x+12</td>
    <td>Put the x termfirst</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>4 4 4</td>
    <td>Divide each termby 4</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>y =-
3
4
x+3</td>
    <td>Recall slope-intercept equation</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>y =mx+b</td>
    <td>Idenfitymand b</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>m=-
3
4
, b=3</td>
    <td>Make the graph</td> 
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>Starting with a point at the y-intercept
of 3,</br></br>Then use the slope rise
run, but its negative
so it will go downhill, so we will
drop 3 units and run 4 units to find
the next point.</br></br>Once we have both points, connect the
dots to get our graph.</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to find the next point with
use a coordinate such as (4, - 2) to find an individule point. Coordinates such as
(4, - 2) start from the origin and move horizontally first, and vertically second.
Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The
numerator is the vertical change and the denominator is the horizontal change.</p>
<p>Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very different. Zero
slope, or horiztonal line, will simply have a slope of zero which when multiplied
by x gives zero. So the equation simply becomes y = b or y is equal to the y-coordinate
of the graph. If we have no slope, or a vertical line, the equation can’t be
written in slope intercept at all because the slope is undefined. There is no y in
these equations. We will simply make x equal to the x-coordinate of the graph.</p>
<p><b>Example 3b-7:</b></p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>GRAPH</td>
    <td>Give the equation of the line in the
graph.</br></br>Because we have a vertical line and no
slope there is no slope-intercept equation
we can use. Rather we make x
equal to the x-coordinate of -4</br></br>x=-4 Our Solution</td>
