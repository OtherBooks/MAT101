<b>Scientific Notation</b>
<br><br>


Polynomials - Scientific Notation
<br><br>


Objective: Multiply and divide expressions using scientific notation and
exponent properties.
<br><br>


One application of exponent properties comes from scientific notation. Scientific
notation is used to represent really large or really small numbers. An example of
really large numbers would be the distance that light travels in a year in miles.
An example of really small numbers would be the mass of a single hydrogen atom
in grams. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these
numbers would normally be very combersome. However, our exponent properties
make this process much simpler.<br><br>
First we will take a look at what scientific notation is. Scientific notation has two
parts, a number between one and ten (it can be equal to one, but not ten), and
that number multiplied by ten to some exponent.<br><br>

ScientificNotation: $a×10b$ where $16 a<10$<br><br>
The exponent, $b$, is very important to how we convert between scientific notation
and normal numbers, or standard notation. The exponent tells us how many
times we will multiply by $10$. Multiplying by $10$ in affect moves the decimal point
one place. So the exponent will tell us how many times the exponent moves
between scientific notation and standard notation. To decide which direction to
move the decimal (left or right) we simply need to remember that positive exponents
mean in standard notation we have a big number (bigger than ten) and negative
exponents mean in standard notation we have a small number (less than
one).<br><br>


Keeping this in mind, we can easily make conversions between standard notation
and scientific notation.<br><br>
Example 1D-1<br><br>
Convert $14$, $200$ to scientific notation <br>Put decimal after first nonzero number<br>
$1.42$ <br>Exponent is howmany times decimalmoved, $4<br>
×104$ <br>Positive exponent, standard notation is big<br>
$1.42×104$ <br>Our Solution<br><br>

Example 1D-2<br><br>
Convert $0.0042$ to scientific notation <br>Put decimal after first nonzero number<br>
$4.2$ <br>Exponent is howmany times decimalmoved, $3
×10-3$<br> Negative exponent, standard notation is small<br>
$4.2×10-3$<br> Our Solution<br><br>

Example 1d-3<br><br>
Convert $3.21×105$ to standard notation<br> Positive exponent means standard notation<br>
big number.Move decimal right $5$ places<br>
$321, 000$ <br>Our Solution<br><br>


Example 1D-4<br>
Convert $7.4×10-3$ to standard notation<br> Negative exponent means standard notation<br>
is a smallnumber.Move decimal left 3 places<br>
$0.0074$<br> Our Solution<br><br>

Converting between standard notation and scientific notation is important to
understand how scientific notation works and what it does. Here our main
interest is to be able to multiply and divide numbers in scientific notation using
exponent properties. The way we do this is first do the operation with the front
number (multiply or divide) then use exponent properties to simplify the $10$’s.
Scientific notation is the only time where it will be allowed to have negative exponents
in our final solution. The negative exponent simply informs us that we are
dealing with small numbers. Consider the following examples.<br><br>

Example 1D-5<br><br>
$(2.1×10-7)(3.7×105)$<br> Deal with numbers and $10$'s separately<br>
$(2.1)(3.7)=7.77$<br> Multiply numbers<br>
$10-7105=10-2$<br> Use product rule on $10$'s and add exponents<br>
$7.77×10-2$<br> Our Solution<br><br>


Example 1D-6<br><br>
$4.96×104$<br>
$3.1×10-3$ <br>Dealwith numbers and $10$'s separately<br>
$4.96$<br>
$3.1$<br>
$=1.6$<br> Divide Numbers<br>
$104$<br>
$10-3$ <br>$=107$<br> Use quotient rule to subtract exponents, be carefulwith negatives!<br>
Be carefulwith negatives, $4-(-3)=4+3=7$<br>
$1.6×107$<br> Our Solution<br><br>

Example 1D-7<br><br>
$(1.8×10-4)3$<br> Use power rule to dealwith numbers and $10$'s separately<br><br>
$1.83=5.832$<br> Evaluate $1.83$
$(10-4)3=10-12$ <br>Multiply exponents<br>
$5.832×10-12$ <br>Our Solution<br><br>

Often when we multiply or divide in scientific notation the end result is not in scientific
notation. We will then have to convert the front number into scientific
notation and then combine the $10$’s using the product property of exponents and
adding the exponents. This is shown in the following examples.<br><br>

Example 1D-7<br><br>
$(4.7×10-3)(6.1×109)$<br> Dealwith numbers and $10$'s separately<br>
$(4.7)(6.1)=28.67$<br> Multiply numbers<br>
$2.867×101$<br> Convert this number into scientific notation<br>
$10110-3109=107$<br> Use product rule, add exponents, using $101$ from conversion<br>
$2.867×107$<br> Our Solution<br><br>

World View Note: Archimedes (287 BC - 212 BC), the Greek mathematician,
developed a system for representing large numbers using a system very similar to
scientific notation. He used his system to calculate the number of grains of sand it
would take to fill the universe. His conclusion was 1063 grains of sand because he
figured the universe to have a diameter of 1014 stadia or about 2 light years.<br><br>


Example 1D-8<br><br>
$2.014×10-3$<br>
$3.8×10-7$<br> Deal with numbers and $10$'s separately<br>
$2.014$<br>
$3.8$<br>
$=0.53$<br> Divide numbers<br>
$0.53=5.3×10-1$<br> Change this number into scientific notation
$10-110-3$<br>
$10-7$ <br>$=103$ <br>Use product and quotient rule, using $10-1$ from the conversion<br>
Be carefulwith signs:<br>
$(-1)+(-3)-(-7)=(-1)+(-3)+7=3$
$5.3×103$<br> Our Solution<br><br>
