<b>Operations of Numbers</b>
<br><br>

<b>Objectives:</b> Evaluate expressions using the order of operations, including the use of absolute value.  Simplify algebraic expressions by substituting given values, distributing, and combining like terms.<br><br>


When simplifying expressions it is important that we simplify them in the correct order. Consider the following problem done two different ways:
<br><br>


<b>Example 1B-1:</b>
<br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$\underbrace{2+5} · 3$</td>

    <td>Add First</td>
    <td> &nbsp&nbsp versus &nbsp&nbsp  </td>
    
    <td>$2+\underbrace{5 · 3}$</td>
    
    <td>Multiply First</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$7 · 3$</td>

    <td>Multiply</td>
    <td> &nbsp&nbsp </td>
    <td>$2+ 15$</td>

    <td>Add</td>
  </tr>


<tr>

    <td>$21$</td>

    <td>Solution</td>
    <td> &nbsp&nbsp </td>
    <td>$17$</td>

    <td>Solution</td>
  </tr>


</table>

</center>
<br><br>


The previous example illustrates that if the same problem is done two different ways we will arrive at two deifferent solutions. However, only one method can be correct. It turns out the secont method, 17, is the correct method. The order of operations ends with the most basic of operations, addition (or subtraction). Before addition is completed we must do repeated addition or multiplication (or division). Before multiplication is completed we must do repeated multiplication or exponents. When we want to do something out of order and make it come first we will put it in parenthesis (or grouping symbols). This list then is our order of operantons we will use to simplify expressions.
<br><br>

<center>
<b><u>Order of Operations:</u><br><br>


Parenthesis (Grouping)<br><br>


Exponents<br><br>


Multiply and Divide (Left to Right)<br><br>


Add and Subtract (Left to Right)</b><br><br>

</center>


Multiply and Divide are on the same level because they are the same operation (division is just multiplying by the reciprocal). This means they must be done left to right, so some problems we will divide first, others we will multiply first. The same is true for adding and subtracting (subtracting is just adding the opposite).
Often students use the word PEMDAS to remember the order of operations, as the first letter of each operation creates the word PEMDAS.  However, it is the author’s suggestion to think about PEMDAS as a vertical word written as:
<br><center> 
P <br>
E <br>
MD <br>
AS<br> </center>



so we don’t forget that multiplication and division are done left to right (same with addition and subtraction). Another way students remember the order of operations is to think of a phrase such as “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally” where each word starts with the same letters as the order of operations start with.<br><br>


<b>World View Note:</b> The first use of grouping symbols are found in 1646 in the Dutch mathematician, Franciscus van Schooten’s text, Vieta.  He used a bar over the expression that is to be evaluated first. So problems like $2(3 + 5)$ were written as $2\cdot \overline{3 + 5}$.<br><br>

<b>Example 1B-2:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$2 + 3(\underbrace{9 - 4})^2$</td>

    <td>Parenthesis first (subtract)</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$2 + 3\underbrace{(5)^2}$</td>
    <td>Exponents</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$2 + \underbrace{3(25)}$</td>

    <td>Multiply</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$\underbrace{2 + 75}$</td>
    <td>Add</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$77$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
<br><br>


It is very important to remember to multiply and divide from from left to right!<br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-3:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$\underbrace{30 \div 3} \cdot 2$</td>

    <td>Divide first (left to right!)</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$\underbrace{10 \cdot 2}$</td>
    <td>Multiply</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$20$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>


</table>

</center>
<br><br>


In the previous example, if we had multiplied first, five would have been  the answer which is incorrect.<br><br>

If there are several parenthesis in a problem we will start with the inner most parenthesis and work our way out. Inside each parenthesis we simplify using the order of operations as well. To make it easier to know which parenthesis goes with which parenthesis, different types of parenthesis will be used such as { } and [ ] and ( ), these parenthesis all mean the same thing, they are parenthesis and must be evaluated first.<br><br>

<b>Example 1B-4:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$2\{8^2 - 7[32 - 4(\underbrace{3^2} + 1)]( - 1)\}$</td>

    <td>Inner most parenthesis, exponents first</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$2\{8^2 - 7[32 - 4(\underbrace{9 + 1})]( - 1)\}$</td>
    <td>Add inside those parenthesis</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$2\{8^2 - 7[32 -\underbrace{ 4(10)}]( - 1)\}$</td>

    <td>Multiply inside inner most parenthesis</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$2\{8^2 - 7[\underbrace{32 - 40}]( - 1)\}$</td>

    <td>Subtract inside those parenthesis</td>

  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$2\{\underbrace{8^2} - 7[ - 8]( - 1)\}$</td>

    <td>Exponents next</td>

  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$2\{64\underbrace{- 7[ - 8]}( - 1)\}$</td>

    <td>Multiply left to right, sign with the number</td>

  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$2\{64 + \underbrace{56( - 1)}\}$</td>

    <td>Finish multiplying</td>

  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$2\{\underbrace{64 - 56}\}$</td>

    <td>Subtract inside parenthesis</td>

  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$\underbrace{2\{8\}}$</td>

    <td>Multiply</td>

  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$16$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>


As the above example illustrates, it can take several steps to complete a problem. The key to successfully solve order of operations problems is to take the time to show your work and do one step at a time. This will reduce the chance of making a mistake along the way.
<br><br>
There are several types of grouping symbols that can be used besides parenthesis. One type is a fraction bar. If we have a fraction, the entire numerator and the entire denominator must be evaluated before we reduce the fraction. In these cases we can simplify in both the numerator and denominator at the same time.
<br><br>

<b>Example 1B-5:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$\dfrac{\overbrace{2^4} - ( - 8) \cdot 3}{\underbrace{15 \div 5} - 1}$
</td>

    <td>Exponent in the numerator, divide in denominator</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$\dfrac{16 - \overbrace{( - 8) \cdot 3}}{\underbrace{3 - 1}}$
</td>
    <td>Multiply in the numerator, subtract in denominator</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$\dfrac{\overbrace{16 - (-24)}}{2}$	
</td>

    <td>Add the opposite to simplify numerator, denominator is done.
</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$\dfrac{40}{2}$
</td>

    <td>Reduce, divide</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$20$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>


Another type of grouping symbol that also has an operation  with  it,  absolute value. When we have absolute value we will evaluate everything inside the absolute value, just as if it were a normal parenthesis. Then once the inside is completed we will take the absolute value, or distance from zero, to make the number positive.<br><br>

<b>Example 1B-6:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$1 + 3| - \underbrace{4^2} - ( - 8)| + 2|3 + \underbrace{( - 5)^2}|$</td>

    <td>Evaluate absolute values first, exponents</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$1 + 3|\underbrace{- 16 - ( - 8)}| + 2|\underbrace{3 + 25}|$</td>
    <td>Add inside absolute values</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$1 + 3\underbrace{| - 8|} + 2\underbrace{|28|}$</td>

    <td>Evaluate absolute values</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$1 + \underbrace{3(8)} + 2(28)$</td>

    <td>Multiply left to right</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$1 + 24 + \underbrace{2(28)}$</td>

    <td>Finish multiplying</td>

  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$\underbrace{1 + 24} + 56$</td>

    <td>Add left to right</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$\underbrace{25 + 56}$</td>

    <td>Add</td>
  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$81$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>


The above example also illustrates an important point about exponents. Exponents only are considered to be on the number they are attached to. This means when we see $- 4^2$, only the $4$ is squared, giving us $-(4^2)$ or $-16$. But when the negative is in parentheses, such as $(-5)^2$ the negative is part of the number and is also squared giving us a positive solution, $25$.
<br><br>

In algebra we will often need to simplify an expression to make it easier to use.  There are three basic forms of simplifying which we will review here.

<br> <br>

<b>World View Note:</b> The term “Algebra” comes from the Arabic word al-jabr which means “reunion”. It was first used in Iraq in 830 AD by Mohammad ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi.

<br><br>

The first form of simplifying expressions is used when we know what number each
variable in the expression represents. If we know what they represent we can
replace each variable with the equivalent number and simplify what remains using
order of operations. <br><br>

<b>Example 1B-7:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$p(q +6)$ when $p=3$ and $q=5$</td>

    <td>Replace $p$ with $3$ and $q$ with $5$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$(3)((5)+6)$</td>
    <td>Evaluate parenthesis</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$(3)(11)$</td>

    <td>Multiply</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$33$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>

Whenever a variable is replaced with something, we will put the new number
inside a set of parenthesis. Notice the $3$ and $5$ in the previous example are in
parenthesis. This is to preserve operations that are sometimes lost in a simple
replacement. Sometimes the parenthesis won’t make a difference, but it is a good
habit to always use them to prevent problems later. <br><br>

<b>Example 1B-8:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$x+zx(3-z)\left(\dfrac{x}{3} \right)$ 
when $x=-6$ and $z =-2$</td>

    <td>Replace all $x$'s with $-6$ and $z$'s with $-2$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$(-6)+(-2)(-6)(3-(-2))\left(\dfrac{(-6)}{3} \right)$</td>
    <td>Evaluate parenthesis</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$-6+(-2)(-6)(5)(-2)$</td>

    <td>Multiply left to right</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$-6+(12)(5)(-2)$</td>

    <td>Multiply left to right</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$-6+(60)(-2)$</td>

    <td>Multiply</td>

  </tr>
<tr>

    <td>$-6-120$</td>

    <td>Subtract</td>
  </tr>


    <td>$-126$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>

It will be more common in our study of algebra that we do not know the value of
the variables. In this case, we will have to simplify what we can and leave the
variables in our final solution. One way we can simplify expressions is to combine
like terms. Like terms are terms where the variables match exactly (exponents
included). Examples of like terms would be $3xy$ and $-7xy$ or $3a^2b$ and $8a^2b$ or $-3$ and $5$. If we have like terms we are allowed to add (or subtract) the numbers in
front of the variables, then keep the variables the same. This is shown in the following
examples: <br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-9:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$5x-2y -8x+7y$</td>

    <td>Combine like terms $5x-8x$ and $-2y +7y$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$-3x+5y$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-10:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$8x^2-3x+7-2x^2+4x-3$</td>

    <td>Combine like terms $8x^2-2x^2$ and $-3x+4x$ and $7-3$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$6x^2+x+4$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>

As we combine like terms we need to interpret subtraction signs as part of the following
term. This means if we see a subtraction sign, we treat the following term
like a negative term, the sign always stays with the term. <br><br>

A final method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with problems
there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem difficult, if not
impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive
property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis
by each term inside of the parenthesis. <br><br>

<center>

<b>Distributive Property:</b> $a(b+c)=ab+ac$

</center> <br><br>

Several examples of using the distributive property are given below. <br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-11:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4(2x-7)$</td>

    <td>Multiply each term by $4$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$8x-28$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-12:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$-7(5x-6)$</td>

    <td>Multiply each term by $-7$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$-35x+42$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>

</table>

</center>
<br><br>

In the previous example we again use the fact that the sign goes with the number.
This means we treat the $-6$ as a negative number, this gives $(-7)(-6) = 42$, a
positive number. The most common error in distributing is a sign error, <b>be very
careful with your signs!</b> <br><br>

It is possible to distribute just a negative through parenthesis. If we have a negative
in front of parenthesis we can think of it like a $-1$ in front and distribute the
$-1$ through. This is shown in the following example. <br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-13:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$-(4x-5y +6)$</td>

    <td>Negative can be thought of as $-1$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$-1(4x-5y +6)$</td>
    <td>Multiply each term by $-1$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$-4x+5y -6$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>


</table>

</center>
<br><br>

Distributing through parenthesis and combining like terms can be combined into
one problem. Order of operations tells us to multiply (distribute) first then add or
subtract last (combine like terms). Thus we do each problem in two steps, distribute
then combine. <br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-14:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$5+3(2x-4)$</td>

    <td>Distribute $3$, multiplying each term</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$5+6x-12$</td>
    <td>Combine like terms $5-12$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$-7+6x$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>


</table>

</center>
<br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-15:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$3x-2(4x-5)$</td>

    <td>Distribute $-2$, multiplying each term</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$3x-8x+10$</td>
    <td>Combine like terms $3x-8x$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$-5x+10$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>


</table>

</center>
<br><br>

In the previous example we distributed $-2$, not just $2$. This is because we will
always treat subtraction like a negative sign that goes with the number after it.
This makes a big difference when we multiply by the $-5$ inside the parenthesis,
we now have a positive answer. Following are more involved examples of distributing
and combining like terms. <br><br>

 <b>Example 1B-16:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$2(5x-8)-6(4x+3)$</td>

    <td>Distribute $2$ into first parenthesis and $-6$ into second</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$10x-16-24x-18$</td>
    <td>Combine like terms $10x-24x$ and $-16-18$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$-14x-34$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>


</table>

</center>
<br><br>

<b>Example 1B-17:</b><br>

<center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>

    <td>$4(3x-8)-(2x-7)$</td>

    <td>Negative (subtract) in middle can be thought of as $-1$</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$4(3x-8)-1(2x-7)$</td>
    <td>Distribute $4$ into first parenthesis and $-1$ into second</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$12x-32-2x+7)$</td>

    <td>Combine like terms $12x-2x$ and $-32+7$</td>

  </tr>

<tr>

    <td>$10x-25$</td>

    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>

</table>
