<b>Applications of Linear Equations</b>
<br><br>


<p><b>Solving Linear Equations - Variation</b></p>
<p><b>Objective:</b> Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and
finding the variation constant.</p>

<p>One application of solving linear equations is variation. Often different events are
related by what is called the constant of variation. For example, the time it takes
to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are traveling. The faster you
travel, the less time it take to get there. This is one type of variation problem, we
will look at three types of variation here. Variation problems have two or three
variables and a constant in them. The constant, usually noted with a k, describes
the relationship and does not change as the other variables in the problem change.
There are two ways to set up a variation problem, the first solves for one of the
variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. Here we will use the
second method.</p>
<p>The greek letter pi () is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter.</p>
<p>World View Note: In the 5th centure, Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi calculated
the value of  to seven decimal places (3.1415926). This was the most
accurate value of  for the next 1000 years!</p>
<p>If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter
you will always get the same value, about 3.14159... If you have a bigger circumference
you will also have a bigger diameter. This relationship is called direct
variation or directly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we
know to divide to find the constant of variation.</p>
<p>Example 92.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>mis varies directly as n</td>
    <td>''Directly'' tells us to divide</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>m/n=k</td>
    <td>Our formula for the relationship</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>



<p>In kickboxing, one will find that the longer the board, the easier it is to break. If
you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board you
will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variables, which means as
one variable increases, the other variable decreases. This relationship is called
indirect variation or inversly proportional. If we see this phrase in the
problem we know to multiply to find the constant of variation.</p>
<p>Example 93.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>y is inversely proportional to z</td>
    <td>''Inversely'' tells us tomultiply</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>yz =k</td>
    <td>Our formula for the relationship</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>The formula for the area of a triangle has three variables in it. If we divide the
area by the base times the height we will also get a constant, 1
2
. This relationship
is called joint variation or jointly proportional. If we see this phrase in the
problem we know to divide the first variable by the product of the other two to
find the constant of variation.</p>

<p>Example 94.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Avaries jointly as x and y</td>
    <td>''Jointly'' tells us to divide by the product</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A
xy
=k</td>
    <td>Our formula for the relationship</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>





<p>Once we have our formula for the relationship in a variation problem, we use
given or known information to calculate the constant of variation. This is shown
for each type of variation in the next three examples.</p>
<p>Example 95.</p>

<p>w is directly proportional to y andw =50when y =5</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>w
y
=k</td>
    <td>'''directly'' tells us to divide</td>


  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(50)
(5)
=k</td>
    <td>Substitute known values</td>


  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>10=k</td>
    <td>Evaluate to find our constant</td>


  </tr>
</table></p>




<p>Example 96.</p>

<p>c varies indirectly as d and c=4.5when d=6</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>cd=k</td>
    <td>''indirectly'' tells us tomultiply</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(4.5)(6)=k</td>
    <td>Substitute known values</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>27=k</td>
    <td>Evaluate to find our constant</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>



<p>Example 97.</p>

<p>x is jointly proportional to y and z and x=48when y =2 and z =4</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>x
yz
=k</td>
    <td>''Jointly'' tells us to divide by the product</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>48)
(2)(4)
=k</td>
    <td>Substitute known values</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>6=k</td>
    <td>Evaluate to find our constant</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>


<p>Once we have found the constant of variation we can use it to find other combinations
in the same relationship. Each of these problems we solve will have three
important steps, none of which should be skipped.</p>
<p>1. Find the formula for the relationship using the type of variation</p>
<p>2. Find the constant of variation using known values</p>
<p>3. Answer the question using the constant of variation</p>
<p>The next three examples show how this process is worked out for each type of
variation.</p>
<p>Example 98.</p>
<p>The price of an itemvaries directlywith the sales tax. If a S25 itemhas a sales tax ofS2,
whatwill the tax be on a S40 item?</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">

    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>''Directly'' tells us to divide price (p) and tax (t)</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>(25)
(2)

    <td>Substitute known values for price and tax</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>12.5=k</td>
    <td>Evaluate to find our constant</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>40

    <td>Using our constant, substitute 40 for price to find the tax</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>(t)40

=12.5(t)</td>
    <td>Multiply by LCD=t to clear fraction</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>40=12.5t</td>
    <td>Reduce the twith the denominator</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>12.5 12.5</td>
    <td>Divide by 12.5</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>3.2=t</td>
    <td>Our solution:Tax is S3.20</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Example 99.</p>
<p>The speed (or rate) Josiah travels to work is inversely proportional to time it
takes to get there. If he travels 35 miles per hour it will take him 2.5 hours to get
to work. How long will it take him if he travels 55 miles per hour?</p>

<p>The amount of simple interest earned on an investment varies jointly as the principle
(amount invested) and the time it is invested. In an account, S150 invested
for 2 years earned S12 in interest. How much interest would be earned on a S220
investment for 3 years?</p>

</table></p>


<p>Sometimes a variation problem will ask us to do something to a variable as we set
up the formula for the relationship. For example,  can be thought of as the ratio
of the area and the radius squared. This is still direct variation, we say the area
varies directly as the radius square and thus our variable is squared in our formula.
This is shown in the next example.</p>
<p>Example 101.</p>
<p>The area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of the radius. A circle
with a radius of 10 has an area of 314. What will the area be on a circle of radius
4?</p>


<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>A
r2 =k</td>
    <td>''Direct'' tells us to divide, be surewe use r2 for the denominator</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(314)
(10)2 =k</td>
    <td>Substitute known values into our formula</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>(314)
100
=k</td>
    <td>Exponents first</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>3.14=k</td>
    <td>Divide to find our constant</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>A
(4)2 =3.14</td>
    <td>Using the constant, use 4 for r, don't forget the squared!</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>A
16
=3.14</td>
    <td>Evaluate the exponent</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>(16)A
16
=3.14(16)</td>
    <td>Multiply both sides by 16</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>A=50.24</td>
    <td>Our Solution:Area is 50.24</td>

  </tr>

<p>When solving variation problems it is important to take the time to clearly state
the variation formula, find the constant, and solve the final equation.</p>


<p>Linear Equations - Number and Geometry</p>
<p>Objective: Solve number and geometry problems by creating and
solving a linear equation.</p>
<p>Word problems can be tricky. Often it takes a bit of practice to convert the
English sentence into a mathematical sentence. This is what we will focus on here
with some basic number problems, geometry problems, and parts problems.</p>
<p>A few important phrases are described below that can give us clues for how to set
up a problem.</p>
<p>• A number (or unknown, a value, etc) often becomes our variable</p>
<p>• Is (or other forms of is: was, will be, are, etc) often represents equals (=)
x is 5 becomes x=5</p>
<p>• More than often represents addition and is usually built backwards,
writing the second part plus the first</p>
<p>Three more than a number becomes x+3</p>
<p>• Less than often represents subtraction and is usually built backwards as
well, writing the second part minus the first</p>
<p>Four less than a number becomes x-4</p>
<p>Using these key phrases we can take a number problem and set up and equation
and solve.</p>
<p>Example 102.</p>
<p>If 28 less than five times a certain number is 232. What is the number?</p>


<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>5x-28</td>
    <td>Subtraction is built backwards,multiply the unknown by 5</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5x-28=232</td>
    <td>Is translates to equals</td>

  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>+28+28</td>
    <td>Add 28 to both sides</td>

  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>5x=260</td>
    <td>The variable ismultiplied by 5</td>

  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>5 5</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by 5</td>

  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>x=52</td>
    <td>The number is 52.</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>



<p>This same idea can be extended to a more involved problem as shown in the next
example.</p>
<p>Example 103.</p>

<p>Fifteen more than three times a number is the same as ten less than six times the
number. What is the number</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>3x+15</td>
    <td>First, addition is built backwards</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6x-10</td>
    <td>Then, subtraction is also built backwards</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3x+15=6x-10</td>
    <td>Is between the parts tells us theymust be equal</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-3x -3x</td>
    <td>Subtract 3x so variable is all on one side</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>15=3x-10</td>
    <td>Nowwe have a two-step equation</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+10 +10</td>
    <td>Add 10 to both sides</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>25=3x</td>
    <td>The variable ismultiplied by 3</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3 3</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by 3</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>25
3
=x</td>
    <td>Our number is
25
3</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>


<p>Another type of number problem involves consecutive numbers. Consecutive
numbers are numbers that come one after the other, such as 3, 4, 5. If we are
looking for several consecutive numbers it is important to first identify what they
look like with variables before we set up the equation. This is shown in the following
example.</p>
<p>Example 104.</p>
<p>The sum of three consecutive integers is 93. What are the integers?</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>First x</td>
    <td>Make the first number x</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Second x+1</td>
    <td>To get the next numberwe go up one or+1</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Third x+2</td>
    <td>Add another 1(2 total) to get the third</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>F +S +T =93</td>
    <td>First (F) plus Second (S) plusThird (T) equals 93</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>(x)+(x+1)+(x+2)=93</td>
    <td>Replace F with x, S with x+1, and T with x+2</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>x+x+1+x+2=93</td>
    <td>Here the parenthesis aren't needed.</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>3x+3=93</td>
    <td>Combine like terms x+x+x and 2+1</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>-3 -3</td>
    <td>Add 3 to both sides</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>3x=90</td>
    <td>The variable ismultiplied by 3</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>3 3</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by 3</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>x=30</td>
    <td>Our solution for x</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>First 30</td>
    <td>Replace x in our origional listwith 30</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Second (30)+1=31</td>
    <td>The numbers are 30, 31, and 32</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Third (30)+2=32</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
</table></p>


<p>Sometimes we will work consective even or odd integers, rather than just consecutive
integers. When we had consecutive integers, we only had to add 1 to get to
the next number so we had x, x + 1, and x + 2 for our first, second, and third
number respectively. With even or odd numbers they are spaced apart by two. So
if we want three consecutive even numbers, if the first is x, the next number
would be x + 2, then finally add two more to get the third, x + 4. The same is true for consecutive odd numbers, if the first is x, the next will be x + 2, and the
third would be x+ 4. It is important to note that we are still adding 2 and 4 even
when the numbers are odd. This is because the phrase “odd” is refering to our x,
not to what is added to the numbers. Consider the next two examples.</p>
<p>Example 105.</p>
<p>The sum of three consecutive even integers is 246. What are the numbers?</p>


<p><table style="width:100%">

    <td>-6 -6</td>

    <td>3x=240</td>

<p>When we started with our first, second, and third numbers for both even and odd
we had x, x + 2, and x + 4. The numbers added do not change with odd or even,
it is our answer for x that will be odd or even.</p>
<p>Another example of translating English sentences to mathematical sentences
comes from geometry. A well known property of triangles is that all three angles
will always add to 180. For example, the first angle may be 50 degrees, the second
30 degrees, and the third 100 degrees. If you add these together, 50 + 30 + 100 =
180. We can use this property to find angles of triangles.</p>
<p>World View Note: German mathematician Bernhart Thibaut in 1809 tried to
prove that the angles of a triangle add to 180 without using Euclid’s parallel postulate
(a point of much debate in math history). He created a proof, but it was
later shown to have an error in the proof.</p>
<p>Example 107.</p>
<p>The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is 40 less than
the first. Find the three angles.</p>

    <td>Replace F , S, and T with the labeled values.</td>

<p>Another geometry problem involves perimeter or the distance around an object.
For example, consider a rectangle has a length of 8 and a width of 3. There are
two lengths and two widths in a rectangle (opposite sides) so we add 8 + 8 + 3 +
3 = 22. As there are two lengths and two widths in a rectangle an alternative to
find the perimeter of a rectangle is to use the formula P = 2L + 2W. So for the
rectangle of length 8 and width 3 the formula would give, P = 2(8) + 2(3) = 16 +
6=22. With problems that we will consider here the formula P =2L+2W will be

<p>We have seen that it is imortant to start by clearly labeling the variables in a
short list before we begin to solve the problem. This is important in all word
problems involving variables, not just consective numbers or geometry problems.
This is shown in the following example.</p>
<p>Example 109.</p>
<p>A sofa and a love seat together costs S444. The sofa costs double the love seat.
How much do they each cost?</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Love Seat x</td>
    <td>With no information about the love seat, this is our x</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sofa 2x</td>
    <td>Sofa is double the love seat, sowemultiply by 2</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>S +L=444</td>
    <td>Together they cost 444, sowe add.</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>(x)+(2x)=444</td>
    <td>Replace S and Lwith labeled values</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>3x=444</td>
    <td>Parenthesis are not needed, combine like terms x+2x</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>3 3</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by 3</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>x=148</td>
    <td>Our solution for x</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Love Seat 148</td>
    <td>Replace xwith 148 in the origional list</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Sofa 2(148)=296</td>
    <td>The love seat costs S148 and the sofa costs S296.</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Be careful on problems such as these. Many students see the phrase “double” and
believe that means we only have to divide the 444 by 2 and get S222 for one or
both of the prices. As you can see this will not work. By clearly labeling the variables
in the original list we know exactly how to set up and solve these problems.</p>

<p>Solving Linear Equations - Distance, Rate and Time</p>
<p>Objective: Solve distance problems by creating and solving a linear
equation.</p>
<p>An application of linear equations can be found in distance problems. When
solving distance problems we will use the relationship rt = d or rate (speed) times
time equals distance. For example, if a person were to travel 30 mph for 4 hours.
To find the total distance we would multiply rate times time or (30)(4) = 120.
This person travel a distance of 120 miles. The problems we will be solving here
will be a few more steps than described above. So to keep the information in the
problem organized we will use a table. An example of the basic structure of the
table is blow:</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Rate</td>
    <td>Time</td>
    <td>Distance</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Person 1</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Person 2</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>

</table></p>

<p>The third column, distance, will always be filled in by multiplying the rate and
time columns together. If we are given a total distance of both persons or trips we
will put this information below the distance column. We will now use this table to
set up and solve the following example</p>

<p>Example 114.</p>
<p>Two joggers start from opposite ends of an 8 mile course running towards each
other. One jogger is running at a rate of 4 mph, and the other is running at a
rate of 6 mph. After how long will the joggers meet?</p>

<p>Some problems will require us to do a bit of work before we can just fill in the
cells. One example of this is if we are given a total time, rather than the individual
times like we had in the previous example. If we are given total time we
will write this above the time column, use t for the first person’s time, and make
a subtraction problem, Total - t, for the second person’s time. This is shown in
the next example</p>
<p>Example 116.</p>
<p>Two campers left their campsite by canoe and paddled downstream at an average
speed of 12 mph. They turned around and paddled back upstream at an average
rate of 4 mph. The total trip took 1 hour. After how much time did the campers
turn around downstream?</p>

<p>Another type of a distance problem where we do some work is when one person
catches up with another. Here a slower person has a head start and the faster
person is trying to catch up with him or her and we want to know how long it
will take the fast person to do this. Our startegy for this problem will be to use t
for the faster person’s time, and add amount of time the head start was to get the
slower person’s time. This is shown in the next example.</p>
<p>Example 117.</p>
<p>Mike leaves his house traveling 2 miles per hour. Joy leaves 6 hours later to catch
up with him traveling 8 miles per hour. How long will it take her to catch up
with him?</p>

<p>World View Note: The 10,000 race is the longest standard track event. 10,000
meters is approximately 6.2 miles. The current (at the time of printing) world
record for this race is held by Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele with a time of 26 minutes,
17.53 second. That is a rate of 12.7 miles per hour!</p>
