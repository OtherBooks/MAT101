<b>MAT-101: Module 2C Linear Models</b>
</p>


<b>Objectives:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the slope of a given linear model and describe its meaning, in context.</li>
  <li>Use a given linear model to solve problems.</li>
  <li>Create a linear model from data to solve problems.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Linear Models</b></p>

<p>Now that you have an understanding of lines, we will consider linear models.  A linear model is an equation for a line that is connected to a real-world situation or data. What does this mean? </p>  
<p>Recall when we write the equation for a line:</p>
$$y=mx+b$$
<p>that $y$ represents the dependent variable (sometimes called the "response" variable) and $x$ represents the independent variable (sometimes called the "predictor"). Plugging in a particular value of $x$ gives, or "predicts," a corresponding value for the response $y$. The value of the slope $m$ of the line represents the estimated change in the response variable $y$ for a one-unit change in the predictor variable $x$.</p>

<p>Consider some examples.</p>

<p><b>Example 2C-1:</b>  Suppose you are driving from Caldwell to LaGrande, OR to watch the Yotes play a game against Eastern Oregon University.  When you reach Ontario, OR (which is 30 miles into the drive) you are able to set your cruise control at 65 miles per hour (mph) for the remainder of the trip.  The linear function $D=65t + 30$ represents your distance from Caldwell $t$ hours after turning on the cruise control.  Notice when $t=0$, your distance $D=30$ which corresponds to you being 30 miles from Caldwell (and in Ontario).</p>

<p><b>Example 2C-4:</b>  A study of king penguins looked for a relationship between how deep the penguins dive to seek food and how long they stay underwater.  The data from the study produced the linear model $DD = 0.0072D + 3$, where $DD$ represents the dive duration in minutes (min) and $D$ represents the depth in meters (m).</p>

<p>Often researchers record observations over time and use a linear model to represent the situation. Consider some examples.</p>

<p><b>Example 2C-7:</b>  In 1980, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States was 3 trillion dollars.  In 1990 it was 6 trillion dollars.  Let the $x$-axis denote time and the $y$-axis the GDP (in trillions).  Let $x=0$ correspond to the year 1980.  Identify points that represent the data.</p>
