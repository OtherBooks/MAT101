<b>MAT-101: Module 1B Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities</b>
</p>


<b>Objectives:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Solve linear absolute value equations. </li>
  <li>Solve, graph and give interval notation for the solution to inequalities with absolute values.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Absolute Value Equations</b></p>

<p>
Solving Linear Equations - Absolute Value
</p>

<p>
When solving equations with absolute value we can end up with more than one possible answer. This is because the expression inside the absolute value can be either negative or positive and we must account for both possibilities when solving equations. This is illustrated in the following example.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1B-1:</b></p>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 84 pg 52-->
<br>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$|x| = 7$</td>
    <td>Absolute value can be positive or negative</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$x=7$ or $x=-7$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Notice that we have considered two possibilities, both the positive and negative. Either way, the absolute value of our number will be positive $7$.</p>

<p><b>World View Note:</b> The first set of rules for working with negatives came from 7th century India. However, in 1758, almost a thousand years later, British mathematician Francis Maseres claimed that negatives "Darken the very whole doctrines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature excessively obvious and simple."</p>

When we have absolute values in our problem it is important to first isolate the absolute value, then "remove the absolute value" by considering both the positive and negative solutions separately. Notice in the next two examples, all the numbers outside of the absolute value are "moved to the other side" first before we remove the absolute value bars and consider both positive and negative solutions.<br><br>

<b>Example 1B-2:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 85 pg 52-->
<br>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$5+|x| = 8$</td>
    <td>Notice absolute value is not alone on the <b>LHS</b></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\underline{-5\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-5}$</td>
    <td>Subtract $5$ from both sides</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$|x| = 3$</td>
    <td>Absolute value can be positive or negative</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$x=3$ or $x=-3$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center><br><br>

<b>Example 1B-3:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 86 pg 52-->
<br>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$-4|x|=-20$</td>
    <td>Notice absolute value is not alone on the <b>LHS</b></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\overline{-4}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{-4}$</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by $-4$</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$|x| = 5$</td>
    <td>Absolute value can be positive or negative</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$x=5$ or $x=-5$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Notice we never combine what is inside the absolute value with what is outside the absolute value. This is very important as it will often change the final result to an incorrect solution. The next example requires two steps to isolate the absolute value. The idea is the same as a two-step equation, add or subtract, then multiply or divide.</p>

<b>Example 1B-4:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 87 pg 53-->
<br>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$5|x|-4 = 26$</td>
    <td>Notice absolute value is not alone on the <b>LHS</b></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\underline{+4\,\,\,\,+4}$</td>
    <td>Add $4$ to both sides</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$5|x| = 30$</td>
    <td>Absolute value still not alone</td>

  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td align="right">$\overline{5\,}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{\,5\,}$</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by $5$</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$|x| = 6$</td>
    <td>Absolute value can be positive or negative</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$x=6$ or $x=-6$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Again we see the same process: get the absolute value alone first, then consider the positive and negative solutions. Often the absolute value will have more than just a variable in it. In this case we will have to solve the resulting equations when we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is shown in the next example.</p>

<b>Example 1B-5:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 88 pg 53-->
<br>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$|2x-1| = 7$</td>
    <td>Absolute value can be positive or negative</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$2x-1=7$ or $2x-1=-7$</td>
    <td>Two equations to solve</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Now notice we have two equations to solve, each equation will give us a different solution. Both equations solve (separately) like any other two-step equation.</p>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$2x-1=7$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,\,$
    <td align="right">$2x-1=-7$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\underline{+1\,+1}$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,\,$
    <td align="right">$\underline{+1\,\,\,\,\,+1}$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td align="right">$2x=8$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,$   or
    <td align="right">$2x=-6$</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\overline{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{2}$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,\,$
    <td align="right">$\overline{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{\,2\,}$</td>
  </tr>
    <td align="right">$x=4$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,\,$
    <td align="right">$x=-3$</td>

  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p> Thus, from our previous example we have two solutions, $x = 4$ or $x = -3$ </p>

<p>Again, it is important to remember that the absolute value must be alone first before we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is illustrated in the below example.</p>

<b>Example 1B-6:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 89 pg 54-->
<br>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    $2-4|2x + 3| = -18$
    </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>To get the absolute value alone we first need to subtract the $2$ from both sides, then divide by  $-4$ (the coefficient on the absolute value).  Notice we cannot combine the $2$ and  $-4$ because they are not like terms: the $-4$ is multiplied by the absolute value expression.  Also notice we do not distribute the $-4$ into the absolute value.  This is because the numbers outside cannot be combined with the numbers inside the absolute value. Thus we get the absolute value alone in the following way:</p>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$2-4|2x + 3| = -18$</td>
    <td>Notice absolute value is not alone</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\underline{-2\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-2\,\,\,\,}$</td>
    <td>Subtract $2$ from both sides</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$-4|2x + 3| = - 20$</td>
    <td>Absolute value still not alone</td>

  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td align="right">$\overline{-4\,}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{\,-4\,}$</td>
    <td>Divide both sides by $-4$</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$|2x+3| = 5$</td>
    <td>Absolute value can be positive or negative</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$2x+3=5$ or $2x+3=-5$</td>
    <td>Two equations to solve</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Now we just solve these two remaining equations to find our solutions.</p>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$2x+3=5$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,\,$
    <td align="right">$2x+3=-5$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\underline{-3\,-3}$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,\,$
    <td align="right">$\underline{-3\,\,\,\,\,-3}$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td align="right">$2x=2$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,$   or
    <td align="right">$2x=-8$</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\overline{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{2}$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,\,$
    <td align="right">$\overline{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{\,2\,}$</td>
  </tr>
    <td align="right">$x=1$</td>
    <td> $\,\,\,\,\,$
    <td align="right">$x=-4$</td>

  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>We now have our two solutions, $x = 1$ and $x = -4$.</p>

<p>As we are solving absolute value equations it is important to be aware of special cases. Remember the result of an absolute value must always be positive. Notice what happens in the next example.</p>

<b>Example 1B-7:</b>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 90 pg 55-->
<br>

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$7+|2x-5|=4$</td>
    <td>Notice absolute value is not alone</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">$\underline{-7\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-7\,\,}$</td>
    <td>Subtract $7$ from both sides</td>

  </tr>

   <tr>
    <td align="right">$|2x-5| = -3$</td>
    <td>Result of absolute value is negative!</td>

  </tr>

  </tr>
</table>
</center><br><br>


<p>Notice the absolute value equals a negative number! This is impossible with absolute value. When this occurs we say there is no solution.</p>

<!--Not considered?????
<p>One other type of absolute value problem is when two absolute values are equal to each other. We still will consider both the positive and negative result, the differ- ence here will be that we will have to distribute a negative into the second abso- lute value for the negative possibility.<br><br>


Example 91.<br><br>

|2x - 7| = |4x + 6|<br>	Absolute value can be positive or negative<br>
2x - 7 = 4x + 6  or   2x - 7 = - (4x + 6)<br>     make second part of second equation negative<br><br>

Notice the first equation is the positive possibility and has no significant differ- ence other than the missing absolute value bars. The second equation considers the negative possibility. For this reason we have a negative in front of the expres- sion which will be distributed through the equation on the first step of solving. So we solve both these equations as follows:<br><br>
2x-7=4x+6<br>
-2x -2x<br>
-7=2x+6<br>
-6 -6<br>
-13=2x<br>
2 2<br>
-13<br>
2<br>
=x<br>
or<br>
2x-7=-(4x+6)<br>
2x-7=-4x-6<br>
+4x +4x<br>
6x-7=-6<br>
+7 +7<br>
6x=1<br>
6 6<br>
x=<br>
1<br>
6<br>

This gives us our two solutions, x= -13
2 or x= 1
6.

<p>
When an inequality has an absolute value we will have to remove the absolute
value in order to graph the solution or give interval notation. The way we remove
the absolute value depends on the direction of the inequality symbol.
</p>

<p>
Consider $|x|<2$.
</p>

<p>
Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this
inequality would be the distance from zero is less than $2$. So on a number line we
will shade all points that are less than 2 units away from zero.
</p>

<center><img src="set1B_Absolute_Value_Equations_and_Inequalities_Interval_.png"></center>

<p>
This graph looks just like the graphs of the three part compound inequalities!
When the absolute value is less than a number we will remove the absolute value
by changing the problem to a three part inequality, with the negative value on the
left and the positive value on the right. So $|x| < 2$ becomes $-2 < x < 2$, as the
graph above illustrates.
</p>

<p>
Consider $|x|>2$.

</p>

<center><img src="set1B_Absolute_Value_Equations_and_Inequalities_Interval2_.png"></center>

<p>
This graph looks just like the graphs of the OR compound inequalities! When the
absolute value is greater than a number we will remove the absolute value by
changing the problem to an OR inequality, the first inequality looking just like
the problem with no absolute value, the second flipping the inequality symbol and
changing the value to a negative. So $|x| > 2$ becomes $x > 2$ or $x <-2$, as the graph
above illustrates.
</p>

<p>
<b>World View Note:</b> The phrase "absolute value" comes from German mathematician
Karl Weierstrass in 1876, though he used the absolute value symbol for complex
numbers. The first known use of the symbol for integers comes from a 1939 edition of a college algebra text!
</p>

<p>
For all absolute value inequalities we can also express our answers in interval
notation which is done the same way it is done for standard compound inequalities.
</p>

<p>
We can solve absolute value inequalities much like we solved absolute value equations.
Our first step will be to isolate the absolute value. Next we will remove the
absolute value by making a three part inequality if the absolute value is less than
a number, or making an OR inequality if the absolute value is greater than a
number. Then we will solve these inequalities. Remember, if we multiply or divide
by a negative the inequality symbol will switch directions!

<p>
In the previous example, we cannot combine $-4$ and $-3$ because they are not like
terms, the $-3$ has an absolute value attached. So we must first clear the $-4$ by
adding $4$, then divide by $-3$. The next example is similar.

<p>
In the previous example, we cannot distribute the $-2$ into the absolute value.
We can never distribute or combine things outside the absolute value with what is
inside the absolute value. Our only way to solve is to first isolate the absolute
value by clearing the values around it, then either make a compound inequality
(an OR or a three part) to solve.
</p>

<p>
It is important to remember as we are solving these equations, the absolute value
is always positive. If we end up with an absolute value less than a negative
number, then we will have no solution! Similarly, if we end up with an absolute value greater than a negative,
this will always happen. Here the answer will be all real numbers.
