<H2>Sets of numbers</H2>
<p>
While we would like nothing more than to delve quickly and deeply into the sheer excitement that is Functions, experience
 has taught us that a brief refresher on some basic notions is welcome, if not completely necessary, at this stage.
 To that end, we present a brief summary of 'set theory' and some of the associated vocabulary and notations we
 use in the text. Like all good Math 'books', we begin with a definition.

<p>
<b>Definition 00-1:</b> A <b>set</b> is a well-defined collection of objects which are called the 'elements' of
the set. Here, `well-defined' means that it is possible to determine if something belongs to the
collection or not, without prejudice.
</p>

For example, the collection of letters that make up the word "coyote" is well-defined and is a set,
but the collection of the worst pizza places in the world is not well-defined, and so is not a set.
In general, there are three ways to describe sets. They are
</p>

<h3>Ways to Describe Sets</h3>
<ol>
<li> <b>The Verbal Method:</b> Use a sentence to define a set.</li>
<li> <b>The Roster Method:</b> Begin with a left brace '$\{$', list each element of the set only once
and then end with a right brace `$\}$'.</li>
<li> <b>The Set-Builder Method:</b> A combination of the verbal and roster methods using a
"dummy variable" such as $x$.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Example 00-1: Describing sets</h3>
<ul>
<li> For example, let $S$ be the set described verbally as: <i>The set of letters that make up the word "coyote".</i></li>
<li> A roster description of $S$ would be $\{c,o,y,t,e\}$. Note that we listed '$o$' only once, even though it
appears twice in "coyote".  Also, the order of the elements doesn't matter, so $\{t,e,y,o,c\}$ is also
a roster description of $S$.</li>
<li>  A set-builder description of $S$ is:
$\{x \; | \; x$ is a letter in the word "coyote"$\}$.  The way to read this is: "The set of elements $x$ such that $x$ is a
letter in the word "coyote".  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In each of the above cases, we may use the familiar equals sign '$=$' and write $S = \{c,o,t,e,y\}$ or
$S = \{x \; | \; x$ is a letter in the word "coyote"$\}$. Clearly $t$ is in $S$ and $q$ is not in $S$.
<!-- We express these sentiments mathematically by writing $t \in S$ and $q \notin S.$-->
 Throughout your mathematical upbringing, you have encountered several famous sets of numbers.
 They are listed below.
</p>

<h3>Sets of Numbers</h3>
<ol>
<li> The Empty Set: $\emptyset = \{ \}$. This is the set with no elements. Like the number
      $0,$ it plays a vital role in mathematics. <tt>WeBWorK</tt> will understand either empty curly braces <tt> $\{\}$</tt> or <tt>NONE</tt>.</li>
<li> The Natural Numbers: $\mathbb{N} = {1, 2, 3, \dots }$ The periods of ellipsis here
       indicate that the natural numbers contain $1$, $2$, $3$, `and so forth.</li>
<li> The Whole Numbers: $\mathbb{W} = {0, 1, 2, \cdots }$</li>
<li> The Integers: $\mathbb{Z} = {\cdots ,-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots}$</li>
<li> The Rational Numbers: $\mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{a}{b}\; |\; a  \mbox{ and } b \mbox{ are integers }.\}$
       Rational numbers are the ratios of integers (provided the denominator is not zero!) It turns out that
       another way to describe the rational numbers is:
       $\mathbb{Q} = \{x \; | \; x \mbox{ possesses a repeating or terminating decimal representation }\}.$</li>
<li> The Real Numbers: $\mathbb{R} = \{ x \; | \; x \mbox{ possesses a decimal representation }\}.$</li>
<li> The Irrational Numbers: $\mathbb{P} = \{ x \; | \; x \mbox{ is a non-rational real number }\}.$ Said another way,
         an irrational number is a decimal which neither repeats nor terminates.c</li>
<li> The Complex Numbers: $\mathbb{C} = \{ a + bi \; | \; a,b \mbox { are in } \mathbb{R} \mbox{ and } i = \sqrt{-1}\}.$
        Despite their importance, complex numbers are not used in this course.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is important to note that every natural number is a whole number, which, in turn, is an integer.
Each integer is a rational number (taking $b = 1$ in the above definition for $\mathbb{Q}$ produces integers) and the
rational numbers are all real numbers, since they possess decimal representations.
For the most part, we will focus on sets whose elements come from the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
</p>
<h2>Interval Notation</h2>
<p>
Recall that we may visualize $\mathbb{R}$ as a line. Segments of this line are called intervals of numbers.
Below is a summary of the so-called interval notation associated with given sets of numbers. For
intervals with finite endpoints, we list the left endpoint, then the right endpoint. We use square
brackets, `$[$' or `$]$', if the endpoint is included in the interval and use a filled-in or `closed' dot, $\bullet$, to
indicate membership in the interval. Otherwise, we use parentheses, `$($' or `$)$' and an `open' circle, $\circ$, to
indicate that the endpoint is not part of the set. If the interval does not have finite endpoints, we
use the symbols $-\infty$ to indicate that the interval extends indefinitely to the left and $\infty$ to indicate
that the interval extends indefinitely to the right. Since infinity is a concept, and not a number,
we always use parentheses when using these symbols in interval notation, and use an appropriate
arrow to indicate that the interval extends indefinitely in one (or both) directions.
</p>
<p>
We will usually abuse the notation when we are considering intervals as sets of numbers.  Instead of using a complete form of
 set-builder notation, we will abbreviate to just the inequality: $x>2$ as a shortened from of $\{x \; |\; x>2\}.$
 With this in mind, let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers with $a < b$.

Note that we could write the inequality $1 < x < 3$ as $3 > x > 1$ and still have the same set. An easy way to
remember which inequality symbol to use is that the smaller (closed) end points to the smaller number and conversely
the larger end (open end) is next to the larger value.  There is some evidence that the inequality sign started
ont as a "distorted" equal sign with one end pinched together to denote the side with the smaller value.
However it came about, the table below gives a few examples of the two notations.

<p>
We will often have occasion to combine sets. There are two basic ways to combine sets:
intersection and union. We define both of these concepts below.</p>
<p>
<b>Definition 00-2:</b>  Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two sets. </br>
 The intersection of $A$ and $B$: $A \cap B = \{ x \; | \;  x \mbox{ is in } A \mbox{ and }  x \mbox{ is in } B\}.$
 </br>
 The union of $A$ and $B$: $A \cup B = \{ x \; | \;  x \mbox{ is in } A \mbox{ or }  x \mbox{ is in } B \mbox{ (or both)}\}.$
</p>
Said differently, the intersection of two sets is the overlap of the two sets--the elements which the
sets have in common. The union of two sets consists of the totality of the elements in each of the
sets, collected together.

<h3>Example 00-3:</h3> For $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{2, 4, 6\},$ we have
$A \cap B = \{ 2 \}$ and $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}.$
</p>
<h3>Example 00-4:</h3> If $A = [-5, 3)$ and $B = (1, \infty),$ then we can find $A \cap B$ and
$A \cup B$ graphically. First, here are the graphs of $A$ and $B$:

<p><center><img src="set00-Preliminaries_15.png" alt=""><p align="center"></center></p>

To find $A \cap B,$ we shade the overlap of the two and obtain $A \cap B = (1, 3).$

<p><center><img src="set00-Preliminaries_15a.png" alt=""><p align="center"></center></p>

To find $A \cup B,$ we shade each of $A$ and $B$ and describe the resulting shaded region
to find $A \cup B = [-5, \infty).$

<p><center><img src="set00-Preliminaries_15b.png" alt=""><p align="center"></center></p>

Here are slightly more complicated situations where the set is in two separate pieces.

<h3>Example 00-5:</h3> Express the following sets of numbers using interval notation:
<table align="center" >
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center">Set of Real Numbers</td>
    <td style="text-align:center">Interval Notation</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center">$x \leq -2$ or $x \geq 2$</td>
   <td style="text-align:center"> $(-\infty, -2] \cup [2, \infty)$</td>

<h2>The Cartesian Coordinate Plane</h2>

<p>In order to visualize the pure excitement that is MAT-102, we need to unite Algebra and Geometry.
Simply put, we must find a way to draw algebraic things. Let's start with possibly the
greatest mathematical achievement of all time: the Cartesian Coordinate Plane. (Named in honor of the
17th century philosopher, mathematician and scientist, Ren&eacute Decartes.)

<p> Imagine two real number lines crossing at a right angle at $0$ as drawn below.  </p>

<p><center><img src="set00-Preliminaries_17.png" alt=""><p align="center"></center></p>

<p>The horizontal number line is usually called the $x$-axis while the vertical number line is usually
called the y-axis. As with the usual number line, we imagine these axes extending off indefinitely
in both directions. Having two number lines allows us to locate the positions of points off of the
number lines as well as points on the lines themselves.</p>
<p>For example, consider the point $P$ shown below. To use the numbers on the axes to label this
point, we imagine dropping a vertical line from the $x$-axis to $P$ and extending a horizontal line from
the $y$-axis to $P$. This process is sometimes called `projecting' the point $P$ to the $x$- (respectively
$y$-) axis. We then describe the point $P$ using the ordered pair $(2,-4).$ The first number in the
ordered pair is the $x$-coordinate and the second is the $y$-coordinate. Taken together, the ordered
pair $(2, -4)$ give the location of the point $P$ with respect to the $x$ and $y$ axes.

<p><center><img src="set00-Preliminaries_17a.png" alt=""><p align="center"></center></p>

Notice that the order in the ordered pair is important--if we wish to plot the point $(-4, 2),$ we would move
to the left $4$ units from the origin and then move upwards $2$ units.</p>

<p><center><img src="set00-Preliminaries_17b.png" alt=""><p align="center"></center></p>

<p>The axes divide the plane into four regions called <b>quadrants</b>. They are labeled Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 and proceed counterclockwise around the plane as shown in the graph below. Note that point $P$ is in quadrant 4 and $Q$ is in quadrant 2.</p>

<p><center><img src="set00-Preliminaries_18.png" alt=""><p align="center"></center></p>

<h2>Mathematical expressions</h2>

<p>
Before beginning the material in MAT-102, you should have be able to simplify basic mathematical expressions with variables
and know how to solve an equation for a variable.  Here are a few examples for your review.
</p>
<h3>Example 00-6:</h3> Evaluate $2p + \dfrac{r^2}{3}$ for $p = -1$ and $r = 4$.
Substitute the values for the variables and simplify:
$$2(-1) + \frac{4^2}{3} = -2 + \frac{16}{3} = \frac{-6}{3} + \frac{16}{3} = \frac{10}{3}$$
<p/>
<h3>Example 00-7:</h3> Simplify: $3(2x+5) -4x$
<br/> In this case you need to remove the parentheses by multiplying in the $3$ so that the like terms may be combined.
$$3(2x+5) -4x$$
$$6x+15-4x$$
$$2x+15$$
</p>
<h3>Example 00-8:</h3> Solve for $x$: $\dfrac{x}{3} + 2 = \dfrac{x}{4}$
<br/> There are many ways to start this problem.  If you don't like fractions you may "clear" the denominators
by multiplying through both sides of the equation by $12$.  Then proceed to combine the $x$'s on one side.
$$12\left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) = 12\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)$$
$$12\left(\frac{x}{3}\right) + 12(2) = 3x$$
$$4x + 24 = 3x$$
$$4x + 24 - 3x = 3x-3x$$
$$x + 24 = 0$$
$$x = -24$$
</p>
<h3>Example 00-9:</h3> Solve for $C$: $S = C + rC$
<br/> The equation must be rearranged so that $C$ is isolated. This can be done by factoring the right side and dividing by $1+r$:
$$S = C + rC$$
$$S = C(1 + r)$$
$$\frac{S}{1+r} = C$$
And we usually write this in the from: $C = \dfrac{S}{1+r}.$
</p>
<h2>Exponent Properties</h2>

Problems with exponents can often be simplified using a few basic exponent properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to discover the important properties.</p>

<p><b>World View Note:</b> The word exponent comes from the Latin "expo" meaning out of and "ponere" meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the Babylonians living in Iraq were the first to do work with exponents (dating back to the 23rd century BC or earlier!)</p>

<p>A quicker method to arrive at our answer would have been to just add the exponents:

$a^3 a^2=a^{3+2}=a^5$. This is known as the <b>product rule of exponents</b>: </p>

<p><center><b>Product Rule of Exponents</b>: $a^m a^n=a^{m+n}$</center> </p>

<p>The product rule of exponents can be used to simplify many problems. We will add the exponent on like variables. This is shown in the following examples: </p>

<p>Rather than multiplying, we will now try to divide with exponents.</p>

<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to just subtract the exponents, $\dfrac{a^5}{ a^2} = a^{5-2}= a^3$. This is known as the <b>quotient rule of exponents</b>.
</p> <p><b><center>Quotient Rule of Exponents:</b> $\frac{a^m}{ a^n} =a^{m-n}$</p></center>

<p>The quotient rule of exponents can similarly be used to simplify exponent problems by subtracting exponents on like variables. This is shown in the following examples:</p>

</center> </p>

<p>A third property we will look at will have an exponent problem raised to a second exponent. This is investigated in the following example:</p>

<h3>Example 00-16:</h3>
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 202 pg 178-->
<br>

<center>
<table class = "center">

    <td>Add exponents</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$a^6$</td>
    <td>Our solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>

</center> </p>



<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to just multiply the exponents, $(a^2)^3 = a^{2\cdot 3} = a^6$. This is known as the<b> power of a power rule of exponents</b> </p>

<p><center><b>Power of a Power Rule of Exponents</b>: $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$ </p></center>

<p>This property is often combined with two other properties which we will investigate now. </p>

<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to take the exponent of three and put it on each factor in parenthesis, $(ab)^3 = a^3b^3$. This is known as the <b>power of a product rule of exponents</b>:</p>

<p><center><b>Power of a Product Rule of Exponents</b>: $(ab)^m=a^m b^m$</p></center>

 <p>It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multiplication inside parenthesis. This property does NOT work if there is addition or subtraction inside the parentheses.</p>

<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to put the exponent on every factor in both the numerator and denominator, $\left(\frac{a}{b} \right)^3=\frac{a^3}{b^3}$. This is known as the<b> power of a quotient rule of exponents</b>:</p>

<p><b><center>Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents</b>: $\left(\frac{a}{b} \right)^m=\frac{a^m}{b^m}$</p></center>

<p>The power of a power, product and quotient rules are often used together to simplify expressions. This is shown in the following examples:</p>

<p>As we multiply exponents its important to remember these properties apply to exponents, not bases. An expression such as $5^3$ does not mean we multiply $5$ by $3$, rather we multiply $5$ three times, $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 125$. This is shown in the next example.</p>

<p>In the previous example we did not put the $3$ on the $4$ and multiply to get $12$, this would have been incorrect. Never multiply a base by the exponent. These properties pertain to exponents only, not bases. </p>

<p>These five properties are often mixed up in the same problem. Often there is a bit of flexibility as to which property is used first. However, order of operations still applies to a problem. For this reason it is our suggestion to simplify inside any parentheses first, then simplify any exponents (using power rules), and finally simplify any multiplication or division (using product and quotient rules). This is illustrated in the next few examples: </p>

<p>Clearly these problems can quickly become quite involved. Remember to follow order of operations as a guide, simplify inside parenthesis first, then power rules, then product and quotient rules.</p>

<h2>Negative Exponents</h2>

<p>There are a few special exponent properties that deal with exponents that are not positive. The first is considered in the following example, which is worked out 2 different ways:</p>

<p><center><b>Zero Power Rule of Exponents</b>: $a^0=1$</p></center>

<p>Any number or expression raised to the zero power will always be $1$. This is illustrated in the following example.</p>

<p>This example illustrates an important property of exponents. Negative exponents yield the reciprocal of the base. Once we take the reciprocal the exponent is now positive. Also, it is important to note a negative exponent does not mean the expression is negative, only that we need the reciprocal of the base.  The next example simplifies a fraction raised to a negative exponent.</p>

  </tr>

</center> </p>


<p>Negative exponents can be combined in several different ways. As a general rule if we think of our expression as a fraction, bases with negative exponents in the numerator must be moved to the denominator with a positive exponent.  Likewise, bases with negative exponents in the denominator need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exponent moves, the exponent is now positive.

<!--This is illustrated in the following example. </p>

<p>As we simplified our fraction we took special care to move the bases that had a negative exponent, but the expression itself did not become negative because of those exponents. Also, it is important to remember that exponents only effect what they are attached to. The $2$ in the denominator of the above example does not have an explicit exponent (which is an exponent of positive $1$), so it does not move to the numerator with the $d$. </p> -->

<p>We now have the following nine properties of exponents. It is important that we are very familiar with all of them. </p>

F(0; 5), G(􀀀7; 0), H(0;􀀀9), O(0; 0).</p>
<p>Solution. To plot these points, we start at the origin and move to the right if the x-coordinate is
positive; to the left if it is negative. Next, we move up if the y-coordinate is positive or down if it
is negative. If the x-coordinate is 0, we start at the origin and move along the y-axis only. If the
y-coordinate is 0 we move along the x-axis only.</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>The axes divide the plane into four regions called quadrants. They are labeled with Roman
numerals and proceed counterclockwise around the plane:</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>1.1 Sets of Real Numbers and the Cartesian Coordinate Plane</p>

<p>For example, (1; 2) lies in Quadrant I, (􀀀1; 2) in Quadrant II, (􀀀1;􀀀2) in Quadrant III and (1;􀀀2)
in Quadrant IV. If a point other than the origin happens to lie on the axes, we typically refer to
that point as lying on the positive or negative x-axis (if y = 0) or on the positive or negative y-axis
(if x = 0). For example, (0; 4) lies on the positive y-axis whereas (􀀀117; 0) lies on the negative
x-axis. Such points do not belong to any of the four quadrants.</p>



<p>One of the most important concepts in all of Mathematics is symmetry.11 There are many types of
symmetry in Mathematics, but three of them can be discussed easily using Cartesian Coordinates.</p>

<p>Denition 1.3. Two points (a; b) and (c; d) in the plane are said to be</p>
<p><center><table>
  <tr>
    <td>symmetric about the x-axis if a = c and b = 􀀀d</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>symmetric about the y-axis if a = 􀀀c and b = d</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>symmetric about the origin if a = 􀀀c and b = 􀀀d</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center></p>


<p>Schematically,</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>In the above gure, P and S are symmetric about the x-axis, as are Q and R; P and Q are
symmetric about the y-axis, as are R and S; and P and R are symmetric about the origin, as are
Q and S.</p>
<p>Example 1.1.3. Let P be the point (􀀀2; 3). Find the points which are symmetric to P about the:</p>

<p><center><table>
  <tr>
    <td>1. x-axis</td>
    <td>2. y-axis</td>
    <td>3. origin</td>
  </tr>

</table>
</center></p>



<p>Check your answer by plotting the points.</p>
<p>Solution. The gure after Denition 1.3 gives us a good way to think about nding symmetric
points in terms of taking the opposites of the x- and/or y-coordinates of P(􀀀2; 3).</p>

<p>1. To nd the point symmetric about the x-axis, we replace the y-coordinate with its opposite
to get (􀀀2;􀀀3).</p>
<p>2. To nd the point symmetric about the y-axis, we replace the x-coordinate with its opposite
to get (2; 3).</p>
<p>3. To nd the point symmetric about the origin, we replace the x- and y-coordinates with their
opposites to get (2;􀀀3).</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>One way to visualize the processes in the previous example is with the concept of a re
ection. If
we start with our point (􀀀2; 3) and pretend that the x-axis is a mirror, then the re
ection of (􀀀2; 3)
across the x-axis would lie at (􀀀2;􀀀3). If we pretend that the y-axis is a mirror, the re
ection
of (􀀀2; 3) across that axis would be (2; 3). If we re
ect across the x-axis and then the y-axis, we
would go from (􀀀2; 3) to (􀀀2;􀀀3) then to (2;􀀀3), and so we would end up at the point symmetric
to (􀀀2; 3) about the origin. We summarize and generalize this process below.</p>

ect a point (x; y) about the:</p>
