<h1>MAT-102: 3C-Radical Functions</h1>
<p>The concept of a radical (or root) is a familiar one which we've used in earlier Units in this course. In this Module, we will start by reviewing properties of radicals and see how they become a way of understanding general power functions. We will brush up on our algebra skills by solving equations involving radicals and consider a new take on composing functions.  We will revisit graphing concepts such as finding intercepts and the domain and range for radical functions and general power function.</p>
<h2>$\S$3C.1  Properties of Radicals</h2>
<p>What is $\sqrt{x^2 + 9}$? Many students will answer quickly that the answer is $(x + 3)$ and have a very difficult
time believing this answer is wrong. But it is wrong.</p>
<p>
For positive values of $x$, $\sqrt{x^2}$ <b>is</b> $x$ and $\sqrt{9}$ <b>is</b> $3$, but
$\sqrt{x^2 + 9}$ is not $(x + 3).$
</p>
<p>Why not? Remember that $\sqrt{x^2 + 9}$ is asking a question: "what <b>squared</b> gives
the answer $x^2 + 9$?" So $(x + 3)$ is not an answer, because $(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x+9$, not $x^2 + 9$.
</p>
<p>As an example, suppose $x = 4$. Substituting into $\sqrt{x^2 + 9}$ gives $\sqrt{4^2 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5$.
But substituting into $(x + 3)$ gives, $(4 + 3) = 7$.  That is, when $x = 4$:
$$\sqrt{x^2 + 9} = \sqrt{4^2 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5\neq 7 = (4+3)=(x+3)$$
</p>
<p>
NOTE: If two numbers are added or subtracted under a square root, you cannot split them up. In
symbols:
$\sqrt{a + b} \neq \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$ or, to put it another way,
$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \neq x + y$</p>.
<p> $\sqrt{x^2 + 9}$ cannot, in fact, be simplified at all. It is a perfectly valid function, but cannot be rewritten in a
simpler form.</p>
<p>How about $\sqrt{9x^2}$? By analogy to the previous discussion, you might expect that this cannot be simplified
either. But in fact, it can be simplified:</p>
<p>$\sqrt{9x^2} = 3x$</p>
<p>Why? Again, $\sqrt{9x^2}$ is asking “what squared gives the answer $9x^2$?” The answer is $3x$
because $(3x)^2 = 9x^2$.
</p>
<p>
Similarly,
$\displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{9}{x^2}} = \frac{3}{x}$ , because
$\displaystyle \left(\frac{3}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{x^2}$.</p>

<p>
There are radicals (or roots) other than a square root: $\sqrt[3]{27}$ means "what number raised to the third power
gives $27$".  In this case, $3^3=27$ so $\sqrt[3]{27} = 3$.  Similarly, $\sqrt[4]{16} = 2$.
</p>

<!--
<p>NOTE: If two numbers are multiplied or divided under a square root, you can split them up. In
symbols:
p
ab =
p
a
p
b,
q
ab
=
p
a p
b</p>


<h2>$\S$3C.2 Simplifying Radicals</h2>
<p>The property
p
ab=
p
a
p
b can be used to simplify radicals. The key is to break the number inside the root
into two factors, one of which is a perfect square.</p>
<p>Example 8.1: Simplifying a Radical</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>p
75</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>=
p
25  3</td>
    <td>because 253 is 75, and 25 is a perfect square</td>

  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>=
p
25
p
3</td>
    <td>because
p
ab =
p
a
p
b</td>

  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>= 5
p
3</td>
    <td>because
p
25 =5</td>

  </tr>
</table>

</p>


<p>So we conclude that
p
75=5
p
3. You can confirm this on your calculator (both are approximately 8.66).</p>
<p>We rewrote 75 as 25  3 because 25 is a perfect square. We could, of course, also rewrite 75 as 5  15, but—
although correct—that would not help us simplify, because neither number is a perfect square.</p>
<p>Example 8.2: Simplifying a Radical in Two Steps</p>

<p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>p
180</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>=
p
9  20</td>
    <td>because 9  20 is 180, and 9 is a perfect square</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>=
p
9
p
20</td>
    <td>because
p
ab =
p
a
p
b</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>= 3
p
20</td>
    <td>So far, so good. But wait! We’re not done!</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>= 3
p
4  5</td>
    <td>There’s another perfect square to pull out!</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>= 3
p
4
p
5</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>= 3 (2)
p
5</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>= 6
p
5</td>
    <td>Now we’re done.</td>

  </tr>
</table>

</p>


<p>The moral of this second example is that after you simplify, you should always look to see if you can
simplify again .</p>
<p>A secondary moral is, try to pull out the biggest perfect square you can. We could have jumped straight to
the answer if we had begun by rewriting 180 as 36  5.</p>

<p>This sort of simplification can sometimes allow you to combine radical terms, as in this example:</p>
<p>Example 8.3: Combining Radicals</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>p
75 ????
p
12</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>= 5
p
3 ?? ?? 2
p
3</td>
    <td>We found earlier that
p
75 = 5
p
3 . Use the
same method to confirm that
p
12 = 2
p
3 .</td>

  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>= 3
p
3</td>
    <td>5 of anything minus 2 of that same thing is 3 of
it, right?</td>

  </tr>
</table></p>



<p>That last step may take a bit of thought. It can only be used when the radical is the same. Hence,
p
2
+
p
3 cannot be simplified at all. We were able to simplify
p
75 –
p
12 only by making the radical in
both cases the same .</p>
<p>So why does 5
p
3?? ?? 2
p
3= 3
p
3? It may be simplest to think about verbally: 5 of these things, minus 2
of the same things, is 3 of them. But you can look at it more formally as a factoring problem, if you see a
common factor of
p
3.</p>
<p>5
p
3?? ?? 2
p
3 =
p
3(5 ?? ??2) =
p
3(3).</p>
<p>Of course, the process is exactly the same if variable are involved instead of just numbers!</p>

<h2>$\S$3C.2 Radicals as Exponents</h2>
The way we generally consider exponents is as repeated multiplication: $10^6$ means $10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10$. But
this definition of exponents does not enable us to answer questions such as:
$$4^0 = ??$$
$$5^{-4}=??$$
$$9^{1/3} = ??$$
You can't "multiply $9$ by itself half a time" or "multiply $5$ by itself $-4$ times." We need a different way of considering
the exponent in these cases.

    <td id="collapseborder">$x^{-5} = \frac{1}{x^5}$</td>
    <td id="collapseborder">$2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}$</td>
    <td id="collapseborder">$8^{3/2} = \sqrt{8^3}$ or $(\sqrt{8})^3$</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>
<p>
Note that you can combine these definitions. For instance, $8^{-2/3}$ is a negative, fractional exponent. The
negative exponent means, as always, "put me in the denominator." So we can write:
$$8^{-2/3} = \frac{1}{8^{2/3}} = \frac{1}{(\sqrt[3]{8})^2} = \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4}$$
</p>
<H3>OK, so why define exponents that way?</H3>
These are obviously not chosen to be the simplest possible definitions. But they are chosen to be consistent
with the behavior of positive-integer exponents.
One way to see that consistency is to consider the following progression:
$$19^4 = 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19$$
$$19^3 = 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19$$
$$19^2 = 19 \cdot 19$$
$$19^1 = 19$$
What happens each time we decrease the exponent by $1$? Your first response might be "we have one less
$19$." But what is really happening, mathematically, to the numbers on the right? The answer is that, with
each step, they are dividing by $19$. If you take $19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19$, and divide it by $19$,
you get $19 \cdot 19 \cdot 19$. Divide that by $19$ again, and you get $19 \cdot 19$ $\ldots$ and so on.
From this we can formulate the following principle for the powers of $19$:
</p>
<p>
<i>Whenever you <b>subtract</b> $1$ from the exponent, you <b>divide the answer</b> by $19.$</i>
</p>
<p>
As I said earlier, we want the behavior of our new exponents to be consistent with the behavior of the old
(positive-integer) exponents. So we can continue this progression as follows:
         $$ \begin{align}
              19^1 & =19 \\
              19^0 & =\frac{19}{19} = 1 \\
              19^{-1} & = \frac{1}{19} \\
             19^{-2}  & = \frac{\frac{1}{19}}{19} = \frac{1}{19^2}\\
          \end{align}$$
$\ldots$ and so on. We arrive at our definitions that anything to the zero power is $1$ and negative exponents
go to the denominator by simply requiring this progression to be consistent.
<p>
More rigorously, we can find all our exponent definitions by using the laws of exponents. For instance,
what is $4^0$? We can approach this question indirectly by asking: what is $\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}$?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The second law of exponents tells us that $\dfrac{4^2}{4^2} = 4^{2-2}$, which is $4^0$.</li>
  <li>But of course, $\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}$ is just $\dfrac{16}{16}$ , or $1$.</li>
  <li>Since $\dfrac{4^2}{4^2}$ is both $4^0$ and $1$, $4^0$ and $1$ must be the same thing!</li>
</ul>
The proofs given below all follow this pattern. They use the laws of exponents to rewrite expressions such
as $\frac{4^2}{4^2}$ , and go on to show how zero, negative, and fractional exponents must be defined. We started with
the definition of an exponent for a positive integer, $10^6 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10$. From there,
we developed the laws of exponents. Now we find that, if we want those same laws to apply to other kinds of exponents,
there is only one correct way to define those other kinds of exponents.

                                          but $\frac{4^2}{4^2} =\frac{16}{16} = 1$ <br/>
                                          so $4^0$ must be $1$!</td>

                                          so $10^{-2}$ must be $\frac{1}{10^2}$.</td>

Now that we have a firm understanding of how to deal with expressions like $x^{n/m}$ where $n$ and $m$ are integers,
we could extend the idea to expressions like $x^r$ where $r$ is a real number. We will demonstrate how such a critter would
be calculated, but not go into the mathematical underpinnings for the expression in this course. Let's see how one would go
about calculating $2^\pi$. Recall that $\pi \approx 3.14159 \dots$. Consider
         $$ \begin{align}
              2^3 & =8 \\
              2^{3.1} & =2^{\frac{31}{10}} =  \sqrt[10]{2^{31}} = 8.5741877 \dots \\
              2^{3.14} & =2^{\frac{314}{100}} =  \sqrt[100]{2^{314}} = 8.815241 \dots \\
              2^{3.141} & =2^{\frac{3141}{1000}} =  \sqrt[1000]{2^{3141}} = 8.821353 \dots \\
              2^{3.1415} & =2^{\frac{31415}{10000}} =  \sqrt[10000]{2^{31415}} = 8.824411 \dots \\
              2^{3.14159} & =2^{\frac{314159}{100000}} =  \sqrt[100000]{2^{314159}} = 8.824962 \dots \\
          \end{align}$$
As we use more digits of $\pi$ the digits of the result begin to stabilize to $8.824 \dots $ after the last calculation.
So, we won't ever get an exact value for $2^\pi$ since $\pi$'s digits don't repeat, but we can get as accurate
a number as we need by using enough digits to calculate $2^\pi$.
</p>
<p>
We now have the idea of the general power function:
<H3>Definition: General Power Function</H3>
A general power function is of the form $$f(x) = x^n$$ where $n$ is a real number.
</p>
Of course, we can make new functions out of power functions. A recent example is the set of polynomials which are
power functions with integer exponents which have been multiplied by numbers and added/subtracted together.

<p><b>Example 3C-1</b> Evaluate $f(x) = \sqrt[4]{x-2}$ at the following points;
<ol type="a">
  <li>$x = 5$: This is $f(5) = \sqrt[4]{5-2} = 3^{1/4} \approx 1.316074$ using a
  calculator for the last step.</li>
  <li>$x = 1$: Here, $f(1) = \sqrt[4]{1-2} = \sqrt[4]{-1}$, but no real number can multiply
   itself four times to get $-4$. $f(1)$ is not defined.</li>
</ol>

</p>
<h2>$\S$3C.3 Radical Equations</h2>
<p>When solving equations that involve radicals, begin by asking yourself: is there an $x$ under the square
root? The answer to this question will determine the way you approach the problem.</p>
<p>If there is not an $x$ under the square root—if only numbers are under the radicals—you can solve much the
same way you would solve with no radicals at all.</p>

<p><b>Example 3C-2:</b>Solve a radical equation with no variables Under square root

<table style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{2}x + 5 = 7 - \sqrt{3}x$</td>
    <td>Notice that there are no variables under a radical</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{2}x +\sqrt{3}x = 7 - 5$</td>
    <td>Get everything with an $x$ on one side, everything else on the other</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$x(\sqrt{2} +\sqrt{3})= 2$</td>
    <td>Factor out the $x$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$x = \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}}$</td>
    <td>Divide, to solve for $x$</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>


<p>The key thing to note about such problems is that you do not have to square both sides of the equation.
$\sqrt{ 2}$ may look ugly, but it is just a number—you could find it on your calculator if you wanted to—it functions
in the equation just the way that the number $10$, or $\frac{1}{3}$ , or $\pi$ would.</p>
<p>If there is an $x$ under the square root, the problem is completely different. You will have to square both
sides to get rid of the radical. However, there are two important notes about this kind of problem.</p>
<ol>
<li> If possible, always get the radical alone, on one side of the equation, before squaring.</li>
<li>  Squaring both sides can introduce false answers—so it is important to check your answers after solving!</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these principles are demonstrated in the following example.</p>

<p><b>Example 3C-3:</b>  Solve a radical equation with the variable under the square root:
<p><table style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{x + 2} + 3x = 5x + 1$</td>
    <td>Here, there is a variable under radical</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{x + 2} = 2x + 1$</td>
    <td>Isolate the radical on one side of the equation by subtracting $3x$</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$x + 2 = (2x + 1)^2$</td>
    <td>Now, square both sides to remove the radical</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$x + 2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1$</td>
    <td>Multiply out. Hey, it looks like a quadratic equation now!</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$0 = 4x^2 + 3x - 1$</td>
    <td>As always with quadratics, get everything on one side.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$0 = (4x - 1) (x + 1)$</td>
    <td>Factor (the easiest way to solve quadratic equations)</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$x = \frac{1}{4}$ or $x = -1$</td>
    <td>Two solutions. Do they work? Check in the original equation!</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>

<table style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <td>Check $x = \frac{1}{4}$</td>
    <td>Check $x = -1$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + 2} + 3(\frac{1}{4})$ $?=?$ $5(\frac{1}{4})+ 1$ </td>
    <td>$\sqrt{-1 + 2} + 3 (-1)$ $?=?$ $5 (-1) + 1$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{8}{4}}+ \frac{3}{4}$ $?=?$ $\frac{5}{4} + 1$</td>
    <td>$\sqrt{1} - 3$ $?=?$ $-5 + 1$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}+\frac{3}{4}$ $?=?$ $\frac{5}{4} + \frac{4}{4}$</td>
    <td>$1 - 3$ $?=?$ $-5 + 1$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{4}$ $?=?$ $\frac{9}{4}$</td>
    <td>$-2 \neq -4$ Not equal!</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$\frac{9}{4} = \frac{9}{4}$ This one works.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>

<p>So the algebra yielded two solutions: $\frac{1}{4}$ and $–1$. Checking, however, we discover that
only the first solution is valid. This problem demonstrates how important it is to check solutions whenever
squaring both sides of an equation.</p>
<p>If variables under the radical occur more than once, you will have to go through this procedure multiple
times. Each time, you isolate a radical and then square both sides.</p>

<p>Remember, the key to this problem was recognizing that variables under the radical occurred in the original
problem two times. That cued us that we would have to go through the process—isolate a radical,
then square both sides—twice, before we could solve for $x$. And whenever you square both sides of the
equation, it’s vital to check your answer(s)!</p>

<h3>When good math leads to bad answers</h3>
<p>Why is it that—when squaring both sides of an equation—perfectly good algebra can lead to invalid solutions?
The answer is in the redundancy of squaring. Consider the following equation:</p>
<p>$-5 = 5$  is false. But square both sides, and we get...</p>
<p>$25 = 25$ which is true. So squaring both sides of a false equation can produce a true equation.</p>

<p>To see how this affects our equations, try plugging $x = -1$ into the various steps of Example 3C-3.</p>
<p>
<table style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{x + 2} + 3x = 5x + 1$</td>
    <td>Does $x = -1$ work here? No, it does not.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$\sqrt{x + 2} = 2x + 1$</td>
    <td>How about here? No, $x = -1$ produces the false equation $1 = –1$.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$x + 2 = (2x + 1)^2$</td>
    <td>Suddenly, $x = -1$ works. (Try it!)</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>When we squared both sides, we "lost" the difference between $1$ and $–1$, and they "became equal."
From here on, when we solved, we ended up with $x = -1$ as a valid solution. So, the moral of the story,
is if you square an equation in the course of solving it, you will need to check your answer to make sure
a false one didn't sneak in.</p>

<h2>$\S$3C.3 Radical Functions</h2>
<p>
When we consider functions like $f(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}$ and $g(x) = x^{1/n}$ it is clear that the domain and range of these
sorts of functions depend on $n$.
<p>
<p><b>Example 3C-4</b> Find the domain and range of $y =f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ given below:
<ol type="a">
  <li>For $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^{2/3}}$, we notice $f$ may be rewritten as $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{\dfrac{1}{x^2}}$
   and any number squared is positive. Taking the cube root of a positive number poses no problem and always results in a
   positive number. The only problem will be at $x=0$ since division by zero is not defined.  Hence, the domain is
   $x < 0$ or $x > 0$.  At first glance, it would seem the range should be numbers between $0$ and $1$ excluding zero, but
   we have to consider all possible values to use for $x$. Note that if $x = -0.01$, then
   $f(-0.01) = \dfrac{1}{(-0.01)^{2/3}} = 100$. Is this enough to convince you that we can make any positive number?
   If not, try a few more values, or better yet, graph $y = f(x)$ to see that the range is $y >0$.</br> </br></li>
   <li> For $g(x) = \sqrt{x + 1}$, the domain consists of all real numbers which may be evaluated in the
  function, hence the domain is $x \ge -1$. The range is the set of numbers which can be produced by $g(x)$.
  Notice that we can make tiny numbers by letting $x$ be values close to $-1$ and we can make zero by
  substituting $x = -1$.  The larger $x$ is, the larger the output value will be, but since the square root is always
  a nonnegative number, the range is $y \ge 0$.   </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Now let's try our hand at finding intercepts:
</p>
<p><b>Example 3C-5</b> Find the intercepts for $y =f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$:
<ol type="a">
  <li>For $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^{2/3}}$:
  <table style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <td>The $y$-intercept is where $x=0$.
    But, $f(0)$ is not defined. $f(x)$ has no $y$-intercept.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The $x$-intercept is where $y=0$.
    Consider: $0 = \dfrac{1}{x^{2/3}}$. The numerator is always $1$
    and the fraction will never be zero.  $f(x)$ has no $x$-intercept.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  </li>
   <li> For $g(x) = \sqrt{x + 1}$,
     <table style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <td>$g(0) = \sqrt{0 + 1} = \sqrt{1} = 1$.
    The $y$-intercept is at $y=1$.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Solve: $0 = \sqrt{x + 1}$.
    Square both sides: $0 = x+1$, so the $x$-intercept is at $x=-1$.</td>
  </tr>
</table>  </li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>In a Module 1C, we considered transformations of functions. It's as good a time as any
to review them.

This section would not be complete with an application (i.e. word problem).
</p>

<p><b>Example 3C-7</b> A basketball player's hang time is the time spent in the air when shooting
a basket.  Hang time can be estimated by the model
$$h = \frac{\sqrt{v}}{2}$$
where $h$ is the hang time in seconds and $v$ the vertical distance of the jump in feet.  Suppose Boo
is a member of the C of I basketball team. If Boo's hang time for a slam dunk is 1.15 seconds, how high did Boo jump?
</br>
Solution: We know that $h = 1.15$ so
    $$\begin{align}
    1.15 & = \frac{\sqrt{v}}{2} \\
    2(1.15) & = \sqrt{v} \\
    (2.30)^2 & = v \\
    \mbox{So, } v & = 5.29
    \end{align}$$
Answer: Boo jumped 5.29 ft high while making the slam dunk.  Go Yotes!

<H3>$\S$3C.4 Composition With General Power and Radical Functions</H3>
We finish this section with a twist to the idea of composing functions.  Previously, we were given
two functions and asked to compose them. For example, if $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ and $g(x) = 2x^3+1$,
$$(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(2x^3+1) = \sqrt{2x^3+1}.$$
However, in Calculus, it is sometimes more necessary to "find" the two functions used in a composition.
<p><b>Example 3C-8</b> For $h(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x+1}}$, find two functions,
$f(x)$ and $g(x)$ so that $h(x) = (f \circ g)(x)$. In other words, we want to deconstruct $h(x)$
into two functions. Actually, there is more than one set of functions that work. For now, it doesn't
matter what the two functions are as long as they make $h(x)$.  It basically takes a little educated
guessing:
<ol  type="a">
  <li>It looks like $x+1$ is "plugged in" to $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}$, so we could have
        $g(x) = x+1$ and $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}$.
        </br>
        We can check: $(f \circ g)(x) = f(x+1) =  \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x+1}}$ $\checkmark$  </br></li>
  <li>Now consider if $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}$ and $g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x+1}$ yield $h(x)$.
        </br>
        Checking: $(f \circ g)(x) = f(\sqrt[3]{x+1}) =  \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x+1}}$ $\checkmark$ </br></li>
  <li>What if we took $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x+1}$ and $g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$?
       </br>
       Let's check: $(f \circ g)(x) = f(\sqrt[3]{x}) =  \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}+1}$ which is <b>not</b>
       $h(x)$. This choice of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ does not work.
       </li>
</ol>
The moral here is: Guess, but check your answer.  You <b>can</b>  know if you have a correct answer.
