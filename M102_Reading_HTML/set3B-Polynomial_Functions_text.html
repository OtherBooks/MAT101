<H1>MAT-102: 3B-Polynomial Functions</H1>

<b>Objectives:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Evaluate, add, subtract and multiply polynomials.</li>
  <li>Identify graphs of polynomial functions.</li>
  <li>Determine the degree and  intercepts of polynomial functions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Many applications in mathematics have to do with what are called polynomials.
Polynomials are made up of terms. Terms are a product of numbers and/or variables.
For example, $5x$, $2y^3$, $-4$  and $ab^3c$ are all terms. Each term has a
<b>coefficient</b>, the number, and a <b>degree</b>, the power of the variable
in the term--if there is more than one variable, then the degree is the sum of the
exponents on the variables.
</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-1:</b></p>
Here is the breakdown of coefficients and degrees for the examples we just gave:
<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
     <td align="center">Term</td>
     <td>Coefficient</td>
     <td>Degree</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td align="center">$5x$</td>
     <td align="center">$5$</td>
     <td>$1$ since $x = x^1$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td align="center">$2y^3$</td>
     <td align="center">$2$</td>
     <td>$3$</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td align="center">$-4$</td>
     <td align="center">$-4$</td>
     <td>$0$ since $-4 = -4(1)$ and $1 = x^0$</td>
      </tr>
   <tr>
      <td align="center">$ab^3c$</td>
     <td align="center">$1$ (why?) </td>
     <td>$5$ since $ab^3c = a^1b^3c^1$ nad $1+3+1=5$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

Terms are connected to each other by addition or subtraction. Expressions are often named
 based on the number of terms in them. A <b>monomial</b> has one term, such as
 $3x^2.$ A  <b>binomial</b> has two terms, such as $a^2 - b^2.$ A <b>trinomial</b> has three terms,
such as $ax^2 + bx + c.$ The term <b>polynomial</b> means many terms. Monomials,
binomials, trinomials, and expressions with more terms all fall under the umbrella of “polynomials”.
The term with the largest degree is called the <b>leading term</b> of the polynomial and the degree
of the leading term is called the <b>degree of the polynomial</b>.

<p><b>Example 3B-2:</b></p>
Here are some examples:
<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
     <td align="center">Polynomial</td>
     <td>Leading term</td>
     <td>Degree</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td align="center">$1.12x^2 + 5.4x - 1.7$</td>
     <td align="center">$1.12x^2$</td>
     <td align="center">$2$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td align="center">$21 + 3w^4-w^2$</td>
     <td align="center">$3w^4$</td>
     <td align="center">$4$</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td align="center">$10+2x+4xy- 7xy^2$</td>
      <td align="center">$7xy^2$</td>
     <td align="center">$3$</td>
      </tr>
         <tr>
   <td align="center">$5x+2$</td>
      <td align="center">$5x$</td>
     <td align="center">$1$</td>
      </tr>
               <tr>
   <td align="center">$-4$</td>
      <td align="center">$-4$</td>
     <td align="center">$0$</td>
      </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
</p>
<p>
If we know what the variable in a polynomial represents we can replace the variable
with the number and evaluate the polynomial as shown in the following
example.</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-3:</b> Evaluate  $2x^2 - 4x + 6$ when $x = -4$ </p>

<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$2x^2 - 4x + 6$</td>
    <td>Replace variable $x$ with $-4$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$2(-4)^2 - 4(-4) + 6$</td>
    <td>Exponents first</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$2(16) - 4(-4) + 6$</td>
    <td>Multiplication (we can do all terms at once)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$32 + 16 + 6$</td>
    <td>Add</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$54$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>It is important to be careful with negative variables and exponents. Remember
the exponent only affects the number it is physically attached to. This means
$-3^2 = -9$ because the exponent is only attached to the $3.$ Also, $(-3)^2=9$ because
the exponent is attached to the parentheses and affects everything inside. When
we replace a variable with parentheses like in the previous example, the substituted
value is in parentheses. So in the example,  $(-4)^2 = 16$. However, consider
the next example.</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-4:</b> Evaluate $-x^2 + 2x + 6$ when $x=3$</p>

<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td align="right">$-x^2 + 2x + 6$</td>
    <td>Replace variable $x$ with $3$</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$-(3)^2 + 2(3) + 6$</td>
    <td>Exponent only on the $3$, not negative $3$</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$-9 + 2(3) + 6$</td>
    <td>Multiply</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$-9 + 6 + 6$</td>
    <td>Add</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td align="right">$3$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>


<p><b>World View Note</b>: Ada Lovelace in 1842 described a Difference Engine that
would be used to calculate values of polynomials. Her work became the foundation
for what would become the modern computer (the programming language
Ada was named in her honor) more than 100 years after her death from cancer.
</p>

<H2>$\S$3B.1 Adding and Subtracting Polynomials</H2>
<p>Generally when working with polynomials we do not know the value of the variable,
so we will try to simplify instead. The simplest operation with polynomials
is addition. When adding polynomials we are simply combining like terms. Consider
the following example
</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-5:</b>Add the two cubic polynomials</p>

<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td>$(4x^3 - 2x + 8) + (3x^3 - 9x^2 - 11)$</td>
    <td>Combine like terms: </br>
                 $4x^3 + 3x^3 = 7x^3$ and </br>
                 $8-11=-3$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td align ="center">$7x^3 - 9x^2 - 2x - 3$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>Generally final answers for polynomials are written so the exponents on the variable
count down. <i>Example 3B-3</i> demonstrates this with the exponent counting down
$3,$ $2,$ $1,$ $0$ (recall $x^0=1$). Note that this is not a rule for writing polynomials--just
an easy way to organize the terms and to make the degree of the polynomial clear. The
polynomial in <i>Example 3B-3</i> could just as well be written as: $ - 3 - 2x - 9x^2 + 7x^3$
or $ - 2x  + 7x^3 - 3 - 9x^2$, but then we have to "search" through the terms to determine the degree.
</p>
<p>Subtracting polynomials is almost as fast. One extra step
comes from the minus in front of the parentheses. When we have a negative in
front of parentheses we distribute it through, changing the signs of everything
inside. The same is done for the subtraction sign.</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-6:</b></p>

<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td>$(5x^2 - 2x + 7) - (3x^2 + 6x - 4)$</td>
    <td>Distribute negative through second part</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td align ="center">$5x^2 - 2x + 7 - 3x^2 - 6x + 4$</td>
    <td>Combine like terms </br>
    $5x^2 - 3x^2 =2x^2$ and </br>
    $-2x - 6x = -8x$, and </br>
    $7 + 4 = 11$</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td align ="center">$2x^2 - 8x + 11$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>Addition and subtraction can also be combined into the same problem as shown
in this final example.</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-7:</b></p>

<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td>$(2x^2 - 4x + 3) + (5x^2 - 6x + 1) - (x^2 - 9x + 8)$</td>
    <td>Distribute negative through</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td align ="center">$2x^2 - 4x + 3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 1 - x^2 + 9x - 8$</td>
    <td>Combine like terms</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td align ="center">$6x^2-x-4$</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</center>
</p>

<H2>$\S$3B.2 Multiplying Polynomials</H2>
Adding or subtracting polynomials is pretty straight forward--just combine terms which have the same
variables with the same degrees. Multiplying polynomials may seem complicated, but the basic idea is
that you must "thoroughly" multiply them together--every term in one must multiply every term in the
other.

<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set3B-Polynomial_Functions_01.png" width="70%"></td>
    <td>There are $4$ multiplications when multiplying $(4x + 3) (3x - 2)$:</br></br>
    Notice that the term $4x$ must be multiplied by both $3x$ and $-2$ (indicated by the red lines)</br>
   Notice that the term $3$ must also be multiplied by both $3x$ and $-2$ (indicated by the blue lines)</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>
In the next two examples, the multiplication is written out so that you may see how every term
in the first polynomial multiplies every term in the second.  Sometimes you may see how to
do the multiplication without writing down all the steps, but writing the steps helps make
sure you get it right.
</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-8:</b> Multiply:</p>
<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">$(4x + 3) (3x - 2)$</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td align="center">$4x(3x-2) + 3(3x-2)$</td>
    <td>Each term of the first multiplies the second</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td align="center">$12x^2 -8x + 9x - 6$</td>
    <td>Combine like terms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">$12x^2 + x - 6$</td>
    <td>Done</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p><b>Example 3B-9:</b> Multiply:</p>
<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">$(x - 2) (4x^2 - x +5)$</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>

    <td align="center">$x(4x^2 - x +5) - 2(4x^2 - x +5)$</td>
    <td>Each term of the first multiplies the second</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Done</td>

<H2>$\S$3B.3 Graphs of Polynomials</H2>

<p>
So far, we have considered the terminology of polynomials and how to combine them with addition, subtraction and multiplication.  Now let us consider them as functions. What does the graph of a polynomial look like? Here are a few examples:
<!--
</br>
THREE SMALL GRAPHS IN A ROW: $f(x) = x^2+1$, $g(x) = -x^2-x+2$, $h(x) = \frac{2}{7}x^3-\frac{1}{7}x^2-3x$, $k(x) = x^4-2x^3-2x^2$-->
</p>
<div  align="center"><img src="set3B-Polynomial_Functions_02.png" width="70%"></div>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Each of these graphs look quite different from each other, but share some characteristics.
<ul>
  <li> The graphs are all "connected" with smooth bends.  They do not look like piece-wise functions.</li>
    <li> The domain of each consists of all real numbers. (Why?)</li>
  <li> The "ends" of the graph eventually settles into an upward or downward curve. (Note: The graph doesn't really "end", it continues indefinitely, but if you go out far enough, eventually it will consistently move in one direction, either up or down.)</li>
   <li> The graphs all have one vertical intercept, but the number of horizontal intercepts varies from none to many.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-11:</b> Consider the graph of $f(x) = x^2+1$. We'll use the low tech but
effective method of plotting points: </p>
<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>

    <td>$\begin{array}{c|c}
    x & y \\ \hline
   -2 & 5 \\
   -1 & 2 \\
    0 & 1 \\
    1 & 2 \\
    2 & 5 \\
  \end{array}
$</td>
  <td> <img src="set3B-Polynomial_Functions_03.png" width="50%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
The $y$-intercept is at $y=1$ and there is no $x$-intercept since the equation $0 = x^2+1$ has
no solution that is a real number. Notice that if we plot points for values of $x$ further to the left of
$-2$,  the function will produce large positive $y$ values since any negative number squared is positive.
If we try $x$ values to  the right of $2$, we clearly get large positive values for $y$.  We are confident
this graph extends  upward in both directions.
</p>

<p><b>Example 3B-12:</b>  Now, consider $g(x) = -x^2-x+2$.  </p>
<p>The $y$-intercept is easy to find:
         $$ \begin{align}
                y & = -0^2 - 0 +2\\
                y & = 2\\
          \end{align}$$
The $x$-intercept takes a little more work:  How to find when $0 =-x^2-x+2$?  Here's when all that time
you spent learning how to factor comes in handy.  We won't do a lot of factoring in this course and the
"guess and check" method will be sufficient.
</p>
<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td>$0 =-x^2-x+2$</td>
    <td>Multiply both sides by $-1$</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>$0 =x^2+x-2$</td>
    <td>Let's focus on the polynomial and set up to factor,</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>$(x + \Box  )(x +\Box  )$</td>
    <td>We need values which multiply to get $-2$</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>$(x - 2 )(x + 1)$</td>
    <td>Try $-2$ and $1$ and check to see if they work.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>
             $ \begin{align}
                (x-2)(x+1)  &  = x(x + 1) - 2(x + 1)\\
                 & = x^2 + x - 2x - 2\\
                 & = x^2 - x - 2
          \end{align}$
    </td>
    <td>$-2$ and $1$ don't work, so try $2$ and $-1$.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>
                 $ \begin{align}
                  (x+2)(x-1) &  = x(x - 1) + 2(x - 1)\\
                 & = x^2 - x + 2x - 22\\
                 & = x^2 + x - 2
          \end{align}$

    </td>
    <td>Bingo</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
Now, back to the equation: $0 = (x+2)(x-1)$.  The only way to get zero when two numbers are multiplied is for one of the
numbers to be zero:
<p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td> $x + 2 = 0$</td>
    <td> or </td>
        <td> $x -1 = 0$</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> $x = -2$</td>
    <td>  </td>
        <td> $x = 1$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
To see what the "end behavior" is,  note that the leading term produces values of much greater magnitude
than the other terms in the polynomial. For example, when $x = 10$, the leading term makes: $-(10)^2=-100$.
The rest of the polynomial only makes, $-(10)+2 = -8$ and if we go just a little further out, say $x = 15$,
compare the leading term's value to the rest of the polynomial:  $-(15)^2=-225$ versus $-(15)+2 = -13$.
What about the graph for negative values of $x$? Check out: $-(-15)^2=-225$ versus $-(-15)+2 = 17$.  We
can see that the leading term will produce negative $y$-values for $x$ values to the far left or right.
Our analysis shows that both ends of $g(x)$ are downward having negative $y$ values.

<!--
<p>
NOTE:  Usually we "read" a graph from left to right and in the case of $g(x)$, we'd say the $g(x)$ is moving upward
on the left side of NOT SURE WHETHER TO GO INTO THIS HERE OR IF THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO APPROACH IT .

<p><b>Example 3B-13:</b> Let's graph $h(x) = \frac{2}{7}x^3-\frac{1}{7}x^2-3x$.  </p>
<p>It's easy to see that the
$y$-intercept is at $y=0$. We need to factor the polynomial to find the $x$-intercepts. Here's a "tip of the day": factoring
is easier if you factor out the denominators and anything else the terms have in common. Notice below that when we
factor out the $\frac{1}{7}$, we have to adjust the $3$ so that if the $\frac{1}{7}$ were multiplied back in, we'd still
have $3$.<br/>
                     $$ \begin{align}
                   0 = \frac{2}{7}x^3-\frac{1}{7}x^2-3x &  = \frac{1}{7}x(2x^2-x-21)\\
                 0 & = \frac{1}{7}x(2x- 7)(x+3)
          \end{align}$$
  <p><center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td> So, $x = 0$, </td>
  <td> $2x - 7 = 0$</td>
    <td> or,  $x + 3 = 0$</td>

    <td> </td>
  <td align="right"> $x = \frac{7}{2}$</td>
    <td align="right"> $x = -3$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
   For the end behavior: The leading term is $\frac{2}{7}x^3$, the power $3$
   will make negative $y$ values for negative $x$ values and positive $y$ values
   for positive $x$ values.  The left end will be "down" and the right end will go "up".
</p>

</center>

<p><b>Example 3B-14:</b> Finally, we'll graph $k(x) = x^4-2x^3-2x^2$.
</p>
<p>
The $y$-intercept is at $y=0$, but we have a problem when trying to factor to
find the $x$-intercepts:
                     $$ \begin{align}
                   x^4-2x^3-2x^2 &  =  x^2(x^2 - 2x - 2) \\
          \end{align}$$
The only two combinations that multiply to get $-2$ for a "nice" factorization are $1$ and $-2$, or $-1$ and $2$. Checking we
see that
<center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td> $(x + 1)(x - 2) = x^2 - x - 2$ </td>
   <td> and </td>
    <td>$(x - 1)(x + 2) = x^2 + x - 2$ </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p/>
<p>
But neither gives $x^2 - 2x - 2$.  Luckily, for quadratic polynomials, there is a formula
which will give the solutions to equations like, $x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0$, the Quadratic Formula.
We pause to recall what it says:
</p>
<p>

<div class="boxed">
<b>Quadratic Formula</b> For $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are found by
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$
</div>
</p>
<p>
Now we may breathe easier, knowing we can still find the $x$-intercepts even if
we can't factor the polynomial--by the way the Quadratic formula works even if
the polynomial factors nicely--gives you something to think about!
</p>
<p>
Back to the graph: So far, we had $x^4-2x^3-2x^2 =  x^2(x^2 - 2x - 2)$ which means
<center>
<table class = "center">
  <tr>
    <td> $x^2 = 0$  </td>
   <td> or </td>
    <td>$x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0$ </td>
  </tr>
</table>

 and clearly, $x=0$ is one of the $x$-intercepts.  Now, consider the "not so easy" to factor part: $x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0$.  Here, $a=1$, $b=-2$ and $c=-2$. With help from the Quadratic
formula:
                     $$ \begin{align}
                   x  & = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2-4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)} \\
                      & = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4+8}}{2} \\
                      & = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{12}}{2} \\
                   x = \frac{2 + \sqrt{12}}{2}  & \mbox{ or }  x = \frac{2 - \sqrt{12}}{2}
          \end{align}$$
and using a calculator: $x = \frac{2 + \sqrt{12}}{2} \approx 2.732$ or $x = \frac{2 - \sqrt{12}}{2} \approx -0.732$.  At last! We have the $x$-intercepts and we only need to determine the end behavior.  The leading term is $x^4$ and any number raised to the $4$th power
produces a positive number. Hence, both ends are upward.

<p><b>Example 3B-15:</b> We should probably work a few problems with the Quadratic formula, just for practice:
<ol type="a">
    <li> Solve: $x^2 + 3x = 1$
           <br/>
           First, we must rewrite this as an equivalent equation equalling $0$.  That is, subtract $1$ from both sides of the equation.
            $$ \begin{align}
                   x^2 + 3x  & = 1 \\
                   x^2 + 3x - 1   & = 0 \\
          \end{align}$$

           With just a few tries, we can see that we are not going to make a $3$ from integers that multiply to get $-1$.  This indicates we must use the Quadratic Formula: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
           For this particular equation we have $a=1$, $b=3$ and $c=-1$:
            $$ \begin{align}
                   x   &   = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} \\
                  x   &   = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 +4}}{2} \\
                  x  &   = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2} \\
          \end{align}$$
 Remember that there are two values here.  We wrote $\pm$ as a short-cut. The answers are: $x = \frac{-3 + \sqrt{13}}{2} $
 or $x = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{13}}{2} $.
           </li>
    <li> Solve: $x^2 + x  + 5 = 0$
           <br/> Note that $a = 1$, $b = 1$ and $c = 5$:
           $$ \begin{align}
                   x   &   = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)} \\
                  x   &   = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 20}}{2} \\
                  x  &   = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-19}}{2} \\
          \end{align}$$
          But, there is no real number that squares itself to get $-19$. Since the Quadratic Formula always finds the
          solution to a quadratic equation, there must not be any solutions for this equation. Our answer is : No solution.
           </li>
    <li> Solve: $8x^3 - 24x^2 + 18x = 0$
    <br/>
    This equation is not a quadratic, but if we factor it we get:  $2x(4x^2 - 12x + 9) = 0$. One solution is $x = 0$ since we could
    have $2x=0$.  Using the quadratic formula for $4x^2 - 12x + 9=0$ with $a=4$, $b=-12$ and $c=9$:
               $$ \begin{align}
                   x   &   = \frac{-(-12) \pm \sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(4)(9)}}{2(4)} \\
                  x   &   = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 - 144}}{8} \\
                  x  &   = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{0}}{8} \\
                  x  &   = \frac{12}{8} \\
                  x  &   = \frac{3}{2} \\
          \end{align}$$
    Hence, the solutions are $x = 0$ or $x = \frac{3}{2}$.  (Seems like we should have more solutions for all that work!)
    </li>

<p><b>Note:</b> Why study polynomials?  What are they good for?  Many functions are difficult to calculate without a calculator
or computer, for example, trigonometric functions.  How DO calculators or computers calculate values for these functions? The answer
 is based on polynomials which are easier to calculate since they only involve multiplying and addition/subtraction. The graph
 below shows how the polynomial $f(x) = x - \frac{1}{6}x^3 + \frac{1}{120}x^5$ approximates the function $g(x) = \sin(x)$ for $-3 \leq x \leq3$.
