<p>Logarithms</p>

<p>Logarithm Concepts</p>

<p>Suppose you are a biologist investigating a population that doubles every year. So if you start with 1
specimen, the population can be expressed as an exponential function: p (t) = 2t where t is the number of
years you have been watching, and p is the population.</p>
<p>Question: How long will it take for the population to exceed 1,000 specimens?</p>
<p>We can rephrase this question as: “2 to what power is 1,000?” This kind of question, where you know the
base and are looking for the exponent, is called a logarithm.</p>
<p>log21000 (read, “the logarithm, base two, of a thousand”) means “2, raised to what power, is 1000?”</p>
<p>In other words, the logarithm always asks “What exponent should we use?” This unit will be an exploration
of logarithms.</p>

<p>As you can see, one of the most important parts of finding logarithms is being very familiar with how
exponents work!</p>

<p><b>The Logarithm Explained by Analogy to Roots</b></p>

<p>The logarithm may be the first really new concept you’ve encountered in Algebra II. So one of the easiest
<p>ways to understand it is by comparison with a familiar concept: roots.</p>
Suppose someone asked you: “Exactly what does root mean?” You do understand roots, but they are
difficult to define. After a few moments, you might come up with a definition very similar to the “question”
definition of logarithms given above. 3 p
8 means “what number cubed is 8?”</p>
<p>Now the person asks: “How do you find roots?” Well...you just play around with numbers until you find
one that works. If someone asks for
p
25, you just have to know that 52 = 25. If someone asks for
p
30, you
know that has to be bigger than 5 and smaller than 6; if you need more accuracy, it’s time for a calculator.</p>
<p>All that information about roots applies in a very analogous way to logarithms.</p>


<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Roots</td> 
    <td>Logs</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The question</td>
    <td>a
p
x means “what number, raised
to the a power, is x?” As an equation,
?a = x</td> 
    <td>logax means “ a, raised to what
power, is x?” As an equation,
a? = x</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Example that comes out even</td>
    <td>3 p
8 = 2</td> 
    <td>log28 = 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Example that doesn’t</td>
    <td>3 p
10 is a bit more than 2</td> 
    <td>log210 is a bit more than 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Out of domain example</td>
    <td>p
??4does not exist ( x2 will
never give ??4)</td> 
    <td>log2 (0) and log2 (??1) do not exist
( 2x will never give 0 or a negative
answer)</td>
  </tr>

<p><b>Rewriting Logarithm Equations as Exponent Equations</b></p>

Both root equations and logarithm equations can be rewritten as exponent equations.</p>
<p>p
9 = 3 can be rewritten as 32 = 9. These two equations are the same statement about numbers, written in
two different ways.
p
9 asks the question “What number squared is 9?” So the equation
p
9 = 3asks this
question, and then answers it: “3 squared is 9.”</p>
<p>We can rewrite logarithm equations in a similar way. Consider this equation:</p>

<p>log3

1
3

= ??1</p>


<p>If you are asked to rewrite that logarithm equation as an exponent equation, think about it this way. The left
side asks: “3 to what power is

13

?” And the right side answers: “3 to the ??1power is

13

.” 3??1 =

13

.</p>


<p>IMAGE</p>


<p>These two equations, log3

13

= ??1and 3??1 =

13

, are two different ways of expressing the same numerical
relationship.</p>

<p><b>The Logarithm Defined as an Inverse Function</b></p>

<p>p
x can be defined as the inverse function of x2. Recall the definition of an inverse function— f ??1 (x) is
defined as the inverse of f 1 (x) if it reverses the inputs and outputs. So we can demonstrate this inverse
relationship as follows:</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>p
x is the inverse function of x2</td>
    
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3 ! x2 ! 9</td>
    
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9 !
p
x ! 3</td>
    
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>
