<p><b>1.10 Graphing10</b></p>
<p>Graphing, like algebraic generalizations, is a difficult topic because many students know how to do it but
are not sure what it means.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the following graph:</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>If I asked you “Draw the graph of y = x2” you would probably remember how to plot points and draw the
shape.</p>
<p>But suppose I asked you this instead: “Here’s a function, y = x2. And here’s a shape, that sort of looks like
a U. What do they actually have to do with each other?” This is a harder question! What does it mean to
graph a function?</p>
<p>The answer is simple, but it has important implications for a proper understanding of functions. Recall
that every point on the plane is designated by a unique (x, y) pair of coordinates: for instance, one point is
(5, 3). We say that its x -value is 5 and its y -value is 3.</p>
<p>A few of these points have the particular property that their y -values are the square of their x -values. For
instance, the points (0, 0), (3, 9), and (??5, 25) all have that property. (5, 3) and (??2,??4) do not.</p>
<p>The graph shown—the pseudo-U shape—is all the points in the plane that have this property. Any point
whose y-value is the square of its x-value is on this shape; any point whose y-value is not the square of its
x-value is not on this shape. Hence, glancing at this shape gives us a complete visual picture of the function
y = x2 if we know how to interpret it correctly.</p>
<p><b>1.10.1 Graphing Functions</b></p>
<p>Remember that every function specifies a relationship between two variables. When we graph a function,
we put the independent variable on the x-axis, and the dependent variable on the y-axis.</p>

<p><b>1.10.1 Graphing Functions</b></p>
<p>Remember that every function specifies a relationship between two variables. When we graph a function,
we put the independent variable on the x-axis, and the dependent variable on the y-axis.</p>
<p>For instance, recall the function that describes Alice’s money as a function of her hours worked. Since Alice
makes $12/hour, her financial function is m(t) = 12t. We can graph it like this.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>This simple graph has a great deal to tell us about Alice’s job, if we read it correctly.</p>
<p>The graph contains the point (3, 300).What does that tell us? That after Alice has worked for three
hours, she has made $300.</p>
<p>The graph goes through the origin (the point (0, 0)). What does that tell us? That when she works 0
hours, Alice makes no money.</p>
<p>The graph exists only in the first quadrant. What does that tell us? On the mathematical level, it
indicates the domain of the function ( t  0) and the range of the function ( m  0). In terms of the
situation, it tells us that Alice cannot work negative hours or make negative money.</p>
<p>The graph is a straight line. What does that tell us? That Alice makes the same amount of money
every day: every day, her money goes up by $100. ($100/day is the slope of the line—more on this in
the section on linear functions.)</p>
<p>Consider now the following, more complicated graph, which represents Alice’s hair length as a function
of time (where time is now measured in weeks instead of hours).</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>What does this graph h (t) tell us? We can start with the same sort of simple analysis.</p>
<p>The graph goes through the point (0, 12).This tells us that at time (t = 0), Alice’s hair is 12" long.</p>
<p>The range of this graph appears to be 12  h  18. Alice never allows her hair to be shorter than 12"
or longer than 18".</p>
<p>But what about the shape of the graph? The graph shows a gradual incline up to 18", and then a precipitous
drop back down to 12"; and this pattern repeats throughout the shown time. The most likely explanation is
that Alice’s hair grows slowly until it reaches 18", at which point she goes to the hair stylist and has it cut
down, within a very short time (an hour or so), to 12". Then the gradual growth begins again.</p>
<p><b>1.10.2 The rule of consistency, graphically</b></p>
<p>Consider the following graph.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>This is our earlier “U” shaped graph ( y = x2) turned on its side. This might seem like a small change. But
ask this question: what is y when x = 3? This question has two answers. This graph contains the points
(3,??9) and (3, 9). So when x = 3, y is both 9 and –9 on this graph.</p>
<p>This violates the only restriction on functions—the rule of consistency. Remember that the x-axis is
the independent variable, the y-axis the dependent. In this case, one “input” value (3) is leading to two
different “output” values (??9, 9) We can therefore conclude that this graph does not represent a function
at all. No function, no matter how simple or complicated, could produce this graph.</p>
<p>This idea leads us to the “vertical line test,” the graphical analog of the rule of consistency.</p>
<p>Definition 1.3: The Vertical Line Test</p>
<p>If you can draw any vertical line that touches a graph in two places, then that graph violates the
rule of consistency and therefore does not represent any function.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the vertical line test is not a new rule! It is the graphical version of the rule
of consistency. If any vertical line touches a graph in two places, then the graph has two different y-values
for the same x-value, and this is the only thing that functions are not allowed to do.</p>
<p><b>1.10.3 What happens to the graph, when you add 2 to a function?</b></p>
<p>Suppose the following is the graph of the function y = f (x).</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>We can see from the graph that the domain of the graph is ??3  x  6 and the range is ??3  y  2.</p>
<p>Question: What does the graph of y = f (x) + 2 look like?</p>
<p>This might seem an impossible question, since we do not even know what the function f (x) is. But we
don’t need to know that in order to plot a few points.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>f (x)</td> 
    <td>f (x + 2)</td>
    <td>so y = f (x) contains this point</td>
    <td>and y = f (x) + 2 contains this point</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-3</td>
    <td>2</td> 
    <td>4</td>
    <td>(??3, 2)</td>
    <td>(??3, 4)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>-3</td> 
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>(??1,??3)</td>
    <td>(??1,??1)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td> 
    <td>4</td>
    <td>(1, 2)</td>
    <td>(1, 4)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>0</td> 
    <td>2</td>
    <td>(6, 0)</td>
    <td>(6, 2)</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>If you plot these points on a graph, the pattern should become clear. Each point on the graph is moving up
by two. This comes as no surprise: since you added 2 to each y-value, and adding 2 to a y-value moves any
point up by 2. So the new graph will look identical to the old, only moved up by 2.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>In a similar way, it should be obvious that if you subtract 10 from a function, the graph moves down by 10.
Note that, in either case, the domain of the function is the same, but the range has changed.</p>
<p>These permutations work for any function. Hence, given the graph of the function y =
p
x below (which
you could generate by plotting points), you can produce the other two graphs without plotting points,
simply by moving the first graph up and down.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>

<p><b>1.10.4 Other vertical permutations</b></p>
<p>Adding or subtracting a constant from f (x), as described above, is one example of a vertical permutation:
it moves the graph up and down. There are other examples of vertical permutations.</p>
<p>For instance, what does doubling a function do to a graph? Let’s return to our original function:</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>What does the graph y = 2 f (x) look like? We can make a table similar to the one we made before.</p>


<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>f (x)</td> 
    <td>2 f (x)</td>
    <td>so y = 2 f (x) contains this point</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-3</td>
    <td>2</td> 
    <td>4</td>
    <td>(??3, 4)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>-3</td> 
    <td>-6</td>
    <td>(??1,??6)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td> 
    <td>4</td>
    <td>(1, 4)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>0</td> 
    <td>0</td>
    <td>(6, 0)</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>In general, the high points move higher; the low points move lower. The entire graph is vertically stretched,
with each point moving farther away from the x-axis.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>Similarly, y = 12</p>
f (x) yields a graph that is vertically compressed, with each point moving toward the x-axis.</p>
<p>Finally, what does y = ??f (x) look like? All the positive values become negative, and the negative values
become positive. So, point by point, the entire graph flips over the x-axis.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p><b>1.10.5 What happens to the graph, when you add 2 to the x value?</b></p>
<p>Vertical permutations affect the y-value; that is, the output, or the function itself. Horizontal permutations
affect the x-value; that is, the numbers that come in. They often do the opposite of what it naturally seems
they should.</p>
<p>Let’s return to our original function y = f (x).</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>Suppose you were asked to graph y = f (x + 2). Note that this is not the same as f (x) + 2! The latter is an
instruction to run the function, and then add 2 to all results. But y = f (x + 2) is an instruction to add 2 to
every x-value before plugging it into the function.</p>
<p>f (x) + 2 changes y, and therefore shifts the graph vertically</p>
<p>f (x + 2) changes x, and therefore shifts the graph horizontally.</p>
<p>But which way? In analogy to the vertical permutations, you might expect that adding two would shift the
graph to the right. But let’s make a table of values again.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>x + 2</td> 
    <td>f (x + 2)</td>
    <td>so y = f (x + 2) contains this point</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-5</td>
    <td>-3</td> 
    <td>f(–3)=2</td>
    <td>(??5, 2)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>-3</td>
    <td>-1</td> 
    <td>f(–1)=–3</td>
    <td>(??3,??3)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>1</td> 
    <td>f(1)=2</td>
    <td>(??1, 2)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>6</td> 
    <td>f(6)=0</td>
    <td>(4, 0)</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>This is a very subtle, very important point—please follow it closely and carefully! First of all, make sure
you understand where all the numbers in that table came from. Then look what happened to the original
graph.</p>
<p>NOTE: The original graph f (x) contains the point (6, 0); therefore, f (x + 2) contains the point
(4, 0). The point has moved two spaces to the left.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>You see what I mean when I say horizontal permutations “often do the opposite of what it naturally seems
they should”? Adding two moves the graph to the left.</p>
<p>Why does it work that way? Here is my favorite way of thinking about it. f (x ?? 2) is an instruction that
says to each point, “look two spaces to your left, and copy what the original function is doing there.” At
x = 5 it does what f (x) does at x = 3. At x = 10, it copies f (8). And so on. Because it is always copying
f (x) to its left, this graph ends up being a copy of f (x) moved to the right. If you understand this way of
looking at it, all the rest of the horizontal permutations will make sense.</p>
<p>Of course, as you might expect, subtraction has the opposite effect: f (x ?? 6) takes the original graph and
moves it 6 units to the right. In either case, these horizontal permutations affect the domain of the original
function, but not its range.</p>
<p><b>1.10.6 Other horizontal permutations</b></p>
<p>Recall that y = 2 f (x) vertically stretches a graph; y = 1
2 f (x) vertically compresses. Just as with addition
and subtraction, we will find that the horizontal equivalents work backward.</p>


<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>2x</td> 
    <td>f (2x)</td>
    <td>so y = 2 f (x) contains this point</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1 1/2</td>
    <td>-3</td> 
    <td>2</td>
    <td>(-1 1/2, 2)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>-1/2</td>
    <td>-1</td> 
    <td>-3</td>
    <td>(-1/2, -3)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>1/2</td>
    <td>1</td> 
    <td>2</td>
    <td>(1/2, 2)</td>
    
  </tr><tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>6</td> 
    <td>0</td>
    <td>(3, 0)</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>The original graph f (x) contains the point (6, 0); therefore, f (2x) contains the point (3, 0). Similarly,
(??1;??3) becomes

??1
2 ;??3

. Each point is closer to the y-axis; the graph has horizontally compressed.</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>We can explain this the same way we explained f (x ?? 2). In this case, f (2x) is an instruction that says
to each point, “Look outward, at the x-value that is double yours, and copy what the original function
is doing there.” At x = 5 it does what f (x) does at x = 10. At x = ??3, it copies f (??6). And so on.
Because it is always copying f(x) outside itself, this graph ends up being a copy of f (x) moved inward; ie
a compression. Similarly, f

1
2 x

causes each point to look inward toward the y-axis, so it winds up being
a horizontally stretched version of the original.</p>
<p>Finally, y = f (??x) does precisely what you would expect: it flips the graph around the y-axis. f (??2) is
the old f (2) and vice-versa.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>All of these permutations do not need to be memorized: only the general principles need to be understood.
But once they are properly understood, even a complex graph such as y = ??2 (x + 3)2 + 5 can be easily
graphed. You take the (known) graph of y = x2, flip it over the x-axis (because of the negative sign), stretch
it vertically (the 2), move it to the left by 3, and move it up 5.</p>
<p>With a good understanding of permutations, and a very simple list of known graphs, it becomes possible
to graph a wide variety of important functions. To complete our look at permutations, let’s return to the
graph of y =
p
x in a variety of flavors.</p>
