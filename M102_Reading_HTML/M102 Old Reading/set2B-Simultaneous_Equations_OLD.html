<p><b>Simultaneous Equations</b></p>
<p><b>3.1 Distance, Rate and Time</b></p>
<p>If you travel 30 miles per hour for 4 hours, how far do you go? A little common sense will tell you that the
answer is 120 miles.</p>
<p>This relationship is captured in the following equation:</p>
<p>d = rt where...</p>
<p>d is distance traveled (sometimes the letter x is used instead, for position)</p>
<p>r is the rate, or speed (sometimes the letter v is used, for velocity)</p>
<p>t is the time</p>
<p>This is presented here because it forms the basis for many common simultaneous equations problems.</p>
<p><b>3.2 Simultaneous Equations by Graphing</b></p>
<p>Consider the equation y = 2
p
x. How many (x, y) pairs are there that satisfy this equation? Answer: (0, 0),
(1, 2), (4, 4), and (9, 6) are all solutions; and there is an infinite number of other solutions. (And don’t
forget non-integer solutions, such as (, 1)!)</p>
<p>Now, consider the equation y = x + 1/
2 . How many pairs satisfy this equation? Once again, an infinite
number. Most equations that relate two variables have an infinite number of solutions.</p>
<p>To consider these two equations “simultaneously” is to ask the question: what (x, y) pairs make both
equations true? To express the same question in terms of functions: what values can you hand the functions
2
p
x and x + 1/
2 that will make these two functions produce the same answer?</p>
<p>PICTURE</p>

<p>At first glance, it is not obvious how to approach such a question– it is not even obvious how many answers
there will be.</p>
<p>One way to answer such a question is by graphing. Remember, the graph of y = 2
p
x is the set of all points
that satisfy that relationship; and the graph of y = x + 1
2 is the set of all points that satisfy that relationship.
So the intersection(s) of these two graphs is the set of all points that satisfy both relationships.</p>
<p>How can we graph these two? The second one is easy: it is a line, already in y = mx + b format. The
y-intercept is 1
2 and the slope is 1. We can graph the first equation by plotting points; or, if you happen to
know what the graph of y =
p
x looks like, you can stretch the graph vertically to get y = 2
p
x, since all
the y-values will double. Either way, you wind up with something like this:</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>We can see that there are two points of intersection. One occurs when x is barely greater than 0 (say, x = 0.1),
and the other occurs at approximately x = 3. There will be no more points of intersection after this, because
the line will rise faster than the curve.</p>
<p>Exercise 3.2.1</p>
<p>y = 2
p
x</br>
y = x + 12</p>
<p>Graphing has three distinct advantages as a method for solving simultaneous equations.</p>
<p>1. It works on any type of equations.</p>
<p>2. It tells you how many solutions there are, as well as what the solutions are.</p>
<p>3. It can help give you an intuitive feel for why the solutions came out the way they did.</p>
<p>However, graphing also has two disadvantages.</p>
<p>1. It is time-consuming.</p>
<p>2. It often yields solutions that are approximate, not exact—because you find the solutions by simply
“eyeballing” the graph to see where the two curves meet.</p>
<p>For instance, if you plug the number 3 into both of these functions, will you get the same answer?</p>
<p>3 ! 2
p
x ! 2
p
3  3.46</br>
3 ! x + 12
! 3.5<p>
<p>Pretty close! Similarly, 2
p
.1  0.632, which is quite close to 0.6. But if we want more exact answers, we will
need to draw a much more exact graph, which becomes very time-consuming. (Rounded to three decimal
places, the actual answers are 0.086 and 2.914.)</p>
<p>For more exact answers, we use analytic methods. Two such methods will be discussed in this chapter:
substitution and elimination. A third method will be discussed in the section on Matrices.</p>

<p><b>3.3 Substitution</b></p>
<p>Here is the algorithm for substitution.</p>
<p>1. Solve one of the equations for one variable.</p>
<p>2. Plug this variable into the other equation.</p>
<p>3. Solve the second equation, which now has only one variable.</p>
<p>4. Finally, use the equation you found in step (1) to find the other variable.</p>
<p>Example 3.1: Solving Simultaneous Equations by Substitution</p>
<p>3x + 4y = 1</br>
2x ?? y = 8</p>
<p>1. The easiest variable to solve for here is the y in the second equation.</p>
<p>- ??y = ??2x + 8</br>
- y = 2x ?? 8</p>
<p>2. Now, we plug that into the other equation:</p>
<p>- 3x + 4 (2x ?? 8) = 1</p>
<p>3. We now have an equation with only x in it, so we can solve for x.</p>
<p>- 3x + 8x ?? 32 = 1</br>
- 11x = 33</br>
- x = 3</p>
<p>4. Finally, we take the equation from step (1), y = 2x ?? 8, and use it to find y.</p>
<p>- y = 2 (3) ?? 8 = ??2</p>
<p>So (3,??2) is the solution. You can confirm this by plugging this pair into both of the original
equations.</p>
<p>Why does substitution work?</p>
<p>We found in the first step that y = 2x ?? 8. This means that y and 2x ?? 8 are equal in the sense that we
discussed in the first chapter on functions—they will always be the same number, in these equations—they
are the same. This gives us permission to simply replace one with the other, which is what we do in the
second (“substitution”) step.</p>
<p><b>3.4 Elimination</b></p>
<p>Here is the algorithm for elimination.</p>
<p>1. Multiply one equation (or in some cases both) by some number, so that the two equations have the
same coefficient for one of the variables.</p>
<p>2. Add or subtract the two equations to make that variable go away.</p>
<p>3. Solve the resulting equation, which now has only one variable.</p>
<p>4. Finally, plug back in to find the other variable.</p>
<p>Example 3.2: Solving Simultaneous Equations by Elimination</p>
<p>3x + 4y = 1</br>
2x ?? y = 8</p>
<p>1 - The first question is: how do we get one of these variables to have the same coefficient in
both equations? To get the x coefficients to be the same, we would have to multiply the
top equation by 2 and the bottom by 3. It is much easier with y; if we simply multiply
the bottom equation by 4, then the two y values will both be multiplied by 4.</p>
<p>- 3x + 4y = 1</br>
- 8x ?? 4y = 32</p>
<p>2 - Now we either add or subtract the two equations. In this case, we have 4y on top, and
??4y on the bottom; so if we add them, they will cancel out. (If the bottom had a +4y
we would have to subtract the two equations to get the " y"s to cancel.)</p>
<p>- 11x + 0y = 33</p>
<p>3-4 - Once again, we are left with only one variable. We can solve this equation to find that
x = 3 and then plug back in to either of the original equations to find y = ??2 as before.</p>
<p>Why does elimination work?</p>
<p>As you know, you are always allowed to do the same thing to both sides of an equation. If an equation is
true, it will still be true if you add 4 to both sides, multiply both sides by 6, or take the square root of both
sides.</p>
<p>Now—consider, in the second step above, what we did to the equation 3x + 4y = 1. We added something
to both sides of this equation. What did we add? On the left, we added 8x ?? 4y; on the right, we added 32.
It seems that we have done something different to the two sides.</p>
<p>However, the second equation gives us a guarantee that these two quantities, 8x ??4y and 32, are in fact the
same as each other. So by adding 8x ?? 4y to the left, and 32 to the right, we really have done exactly the
same thing to both sides of the equation 3x + 4y = 1.</p>
<p><b>3.5 Special Cases</b></p>
<p>Consider the two equations:</p>
<p>2x + 3y = 8 (3.1) </br>
4x + 6y = 3 (3.2)</p>
<p>Suppose we attempt to solve these two equations by elimination. So, we double the first equation and
subtract, and the result is:</p>
<p>4x + 6y = 16</br>
4x + 6y = 3</br>
0 = 13
(3.3)</p>
<p>Hey, what happened? 0 does not equal 13, no matter what x is. Mathematically, we see that these two
equations have no simultaneous solution. You asked the question “When will both of these equations be
true?” And the math answered, “Hey, buddy, not until 0 equals 13.”</p>
<p>No solution.</p>

<p>Now, consider these equations:</p>
<p>2x + 3y = 8</br>
4x + 6y = 16
(3.4)</p>
<p>Once again, we attempt elimination, but the result is different:</p>
<p>2x + 3y = 8</br>
4x + 6y = 16</br>
0 = 0
(3.5)</p>
<p>What happened that time? 0 = 0 no matter what x is. Instead of an equation that is always false, we have
an equation that is always true. Does that mean these equations work for any x and y? Clearly not: for
instance, (1, 1) does not make either equation true. What this means is that the two equations are the same:
any pair that solves one will also solve the other. There is an infinite number of solutions.</p>
<p>Infinite number of solutions.</p>
<p>All of this is much easier to understand graphically! Remember that one way to solve simultaneous equations
is by graphing them and looking for the intersection. In the first case, we see that original equations
represented two parallel lines. There is no point of intersection, so there is no simultaneous equation.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>In the second case, we see that the original equations represented the same line, in two different forms.
Any point on the line is a solution to both equations.</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>GENERAL RULE: If you solve an equation and get a mathematical impossibility such as 0 = 13
, there is no solution. If you get a mathematical tautology such as 0 = 0 , there is an infinite
number of solutions.</p>
