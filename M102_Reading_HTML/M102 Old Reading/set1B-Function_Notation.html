<p>1.8 Function Notation</p>
<p>1.8.1 Function Notation</p>
<p>Functions are represented in math by parentheses. When you write f (x) you indicate that the variable f is
a function of—or depends on—the variable x.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose f (x) = x2 + 3x . This means that f is a function that takes whatever you give it, and
squares it, and multiplies it by 3, and adds those two quantities.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>7 !</br>
10 !</br>
x !</br>
y !</br>
a dog !</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PICTURE</td>
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>! f (7) = 72 + 3 (7) = 70</br>
! f (10) = 102 + 3 (10) = 130</br>
! f (x) = x2 + 3x</br>
! f (y) = y2 + 3y</br>
! f (dog) = (dog)2 + 3 (dog)</br>
(*not in the domain)</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>The notation f (7) means “plug the number 7 into the function f .” It does not indicate that you are multiplying
f times 7. To evaluate f (7) you take the function f (x) and replace all occurrences of the variable x
with the number 7. If this function is given a 7 it will come out with a 70.</p>
<p>If we write f (y) = y2 + 3y we have not specified a different function. Remember, the function is not the
variables or the numbers, it is the process. f (y) = y2 + 3y also means “whatever number comes in, square
it, multiply it by 3, and add those two quantities.” So it is a different way of writing the same function.</p>
<p>Just as many students expect all variables to be named x, many students—and an unfortunate number of
parents—expect all functions to be named f . The correct rule is that—whenever possible—functions, like
variables, should be named descriptively. For instance, if Alice makes $100/day, we might write:</p>
<p>Let m equal the amount of money Alice has made (measured in dollars)</p>
<p>Let t equal the amount of time Alice has worked (measured in days)</p>
<p>Then, m(t) = 100t</p>
<p>This last equation should be read “ m is a function of t (or m depends on t). Given any value of the variable
t, you can multiply it by 100 to find the corresponding value of the variable m.”</p>


<p>Of course, this is a very simple function! While simple examples are helpful to illustrate the concept, it is
important to realize that very complicated functions are also used to model real world relationships. For
instance, in Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, if an object is going very fast, its mass is multiplied
by r 1
1?? v2
91016
. While this can look extremely intimidating, it is just another function. The speed v is the
independent variable, and the mass m is dependent. Given any speed v you can determine how much the
mass m is multiplied by.</p>


<p>1.12 Composite Functions</p>
<p>You are working in the school cafeteria, making peanut butter sandwiches for today’s lunch.</p>
<p>The more classes the school has, the more children there are.</p>
<p>The more children there are, the more sandwiches you have to make.</p>
<p>The more sandwiches you have to make, the more pounds (lbs) of peanut butter you will use.</p>
<p>The more peanut butter you use, the more money you need to budget for peanut butter.</p>
<p>...and so on. Each sentence in this little story is a function. Mathematically, if c is the number of classes and
h is the number of children, then the first sentence asserts the existence of a function h (c).</p>
<p>The principal walks up to you at the beginning of the year and says “We’re considering expanding the
school. If we expand to 70 classes, how much money do we need to budget? What if we expand to 75?</p>
<p>How about 80?” For each of these numbers, you have to calculate each number from the previous one,
until you find the final budget number.</p>


<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>PICTURE</td>
    <td>PICTURE</td> 
    <td>PICTURE</td>
<td>PICTURE</td>
<td>PICTURE</td>
<td>PICTURE</td>
<td>PICTURE</td>
<td>PICTURE</td>
<td>PICTURE</td>
  </tr>
  
</table></p>

<p>But going through this process each time is tedious. What you want is one function that puts the entire
chain together: “You tell me the number of classes, and I will tell you the budget.”</p>

</p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td># Classes</td>
    <td>PICTURE</td> 
    <td>$$</td>
  </tr>
  
</table></p>

<p>This is a composite function—a function that represents in one function, the results of an entire chain of
dependent functions. Since such chains are very common in real life, finding composite functions is a very
important skill.</p>

<p><b>1.12.1 How do you make a composite Function?</b></p>
</p>We can consider how to build composite functions into the function game that we played on the first day.
Suppose Susan takes any number you give her, quadruples it, and adds 6. Al takes any number you give
him and divides it by 2. Mathematically, we can represent the two functions like this:</p>
<p>S (x) = 4x + 6</p>
<p>A (x) = x
2</p>
<p>To create a chain like the one above, we give a number to Susan; she acts on it, and gives the resulting
number to Al; and he then acts on it and hands back a third number.</p>
<p>3 ! Susan ! S (3) = 18 ! Al ! A (18) = 9</p>
<p>In this example, we are plugging S (3)—in other words, 18— into Al’s function. In general, for any x that
comes in, we are plugging S (x) into A (x). So we could represent the entire process as A (S (x)). This
notation for composite functions is really nothing new: it means that you are plugging S (x) into the A
function.</p>
<p>But in this case, recall that S (x) = 4x + 6 . So we can write:</p>
<p>A (S (x)) = S (x)
2
= 4x + 6
2
= 2x + 3</p>
<p>What happened? We’ve just discovered a shortcut for the entire process. When you perform the operation
A (S (x))—that is, when you perform the Al function on the result of the Susan function—you are, in effect,
doubling and adding 3. For instance, we saw earlier that when we started with a 3, we ended with a 9. Our
composite function does this in one step:</p>
<p>3 ! 2x + 3 ! 9</p>
<p>Understanding the meaning of composite functions requires real thought. It requires understanding the
idea that this variable depends on that variable, which in turn depends on the other variable; and how that
idea is translated into mathematics. Finding composite functions, on the other hand, is a purely mechanical
process—it requires practice, but no creativity. Whenever you are asked for f (g (x)), just plug the g (x)
function into the f (x) function and then simplify.</p>
<p>Example 1.9: Building and Testing a Composite Function</p>
<p>f (x) = x2 ?? 4x</p>
<p>g (x) = x + 2</p>
<p>What is f (g (x))?</p>
<p>To find the composite, plug g (x) into f (x), just as you would with any number.</p>
<p>f (g (x)) = (x + 2)2 ?? 4 (x + 2)</p>
<p> Then simplify.</p>
<p>f (g (x)) =
??
x2 + 4x + 4

?? (4x + 8)</p>
<p>f (g (x)) = x2 ?? 4</p>
<p> Let’s test it. f (g (x)) means do g, then f . What happens if we start with x = 9?</p>

<p>7 ! g (x) ! 7 + 2 = 9 ! f (x) ! (9)2 ?? 4 (9) = 45</p>
<p>So, if it worked, our composite function should do all of that in one step.</p>
<p>7 ! x2 ?? 4 = (7)2 ?? 4 = 45 X It worked!</p>
<p>There is a different notation that is sometimes used for composite functions. This book will consistently
use f (g (x)) which very naturally conveys the idea of “plugging g (x) into f (x).” However, you will
sometimes see the same thing written as f g (x), which more naturally conveys the idea of

 “doing one
function, and then the other, in sequence.” The two notations mean the same thing.</p>



<p><b>1.13 Inverse Functions</b></p>
<p>Let’s go back to Alice, who makes $100/day. We know how to answer questions such as "After 3 days, how
much money has she made?"We use the function m(t) = 100t.</p>
<p>But suppose I want to ask the reverse question: “If Alice has made $300, how many hours has she worked?”
This is the job of an inverse function. It gives the same relationship, but reverses the dependent and independent
variables. t (m) = m/100. Given any amount of money, divide it by 100 to find how many days
she has worked.</p>
<p>If a function answers the question: “Alice worked this long, how much money has she made?” then its
inverse answers the question: “Alice made this much money, how long did she work?"</p>
<p>If a function answers the question: “I have this many spoons, how much do they weigh?” then its
inverse answers the question: “My spoons weigh this much, how many do I have?”</p>
<p>If a function answers the question: “How many hours of music fit on 12 CDs?” then its inverse answers
the question: “How many CDs do you need for 3 hours of music?”</p>
<p><b>1.13.1 How do you recognize an inverse function?</b></p>
<p>Let’s look at the two functions above:</p>
<p>m(t) = 100t</p>
<p>t (m) = m/100</p>
<p>Mathematically, you can recognize these as inverse functions because they reverse the inputs and the
outputs.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>3 ! m(t) = 100t ! 300</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>300 ! t (m) = m/100 ! 3</td>
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>X Inverse functions</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Of course, this makes logical sense. The first line above says that “If Alice works 3 hours, she makes $300.”
The second line says “If Alice made $300, she worked 3 hours.” It’s the same statement, made in two
different ways.</p>
<p>But this “reversal” property gives us a way to test any two functions to see if they are inverses. For instance,
consider the two functions:</p>
<p>f (x) = 3x + 7</p>
<p>g (x) = 1
3
x ?? 7</p>
<p>They look like inverses, don’t they? But let’s test and find out.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>2 ! 3x + 7 ! 13</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>13 ! 3
x ?? 7 ! 13
3 ?? 7 ! ??83</td>
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td> Not inverse functions</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>The first function turns a 2 into a 13. But the second function does not turn 13 into 2. So these are not
inverses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, consider:</p>
<p>f (x) = 3x + 7</p>
<p>g (x) = 1
3
(x ?? 7)</p>
<p>Let’s run our test of inverses on these two functions.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>2 ! 3x + 7 ! 13</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>13 ! 13
(x ?? 7) ! 2</td>
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>X Inverse functions</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>So we can see that these functions do, in fact, reverse each other: they are inverses.</p>
<p>A common example is the Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversion:</p>
<p>F (C) =

9
5

C + 32 </p>
<p>C (F) =

5
9

(F ?? 32) </p>
<p>where C is the Celsius temperature and F the Fahrenheit. If you plug 100 C into the first equation, you
find that it is 212 F. If you ask the second equation about 212 F, it of course converts that back into 100 C.</p>

<p><b>1.13.2 The notation and definition of an inverse function</b></p>
<p>The notation for the inverse function of f (x) is f ??1 (x). This notation can cause considerable confusion,
because it looks like an exponent, but it isn’t. f ??1 (x) simply means “the inverse function of f (x).” It is
defined formally by the fact that if you plug any number x into one function, and then plug the result into
the other function, you get back where you started. (Take a moment to convince yourself that this is the
same definition I gave above more informally.) We can represent this as a composition function by saying
that f
??
f ??1 (x)

= x.</p>
<p>Definition 1.5: Inverse Function</p>
<p>f ??1 (x) is defined as the inverse function of f (x) if it consistently reverses the f (x) process. That
is, if f (x) turns a into b, then f ??1 (x) must turn b into a. More concisely and formally, f ??1 (x) is
the inverse function of f (x) if f
??
f ??1 (x)

= x.</p>

<p><b>1.13.3 Finding an inverse function</b></p>
<p>In examples above, we saw that if f (x) = 3x + 7, then f ??1 (x) = 1
3 (x ?? 7). We also saw that the function
1
3 x ?? 7, which may have looked just as likely, did not work as an inverse function. So in general, given a
function, how do you find its inverse function?</p>
<p>Remember that an inverse function reverses the inputs and outputs. When we graph functions, we always
represent the incoming number as x and the outgoing number as y. So to find the inverse function, switch
the x and y values, and then solve for y.</p>
<p>Example 1.10: Building and Testing an Inverse Function</p>
<p>1. Find the inverse function of f (x) = 2x??3
5</p>
<p>a.: Write the function as y = 2x??3
5</p>
<p>b.: Switch the x and y variables. x = 2y??3
5</p>
<p>c.: Solve for y. 5x = 2y ?? 3. 5x + 3 = 2y. 5x+3
2 = y. So f ??1 (x) = 5x+3
2 .</p>
<p>2. Test to make sure this solution fills the definition of an inverse function.</p>
<p>a.: Pick a number, and plug it into the original function. 9 ! f (x) ! 3.</p>
<p>b.: See if the inverse function reverses this process. 3 ! f ??1 (x) ! 9. X It worked!</p>
<p>Were you surprised by the answer? At first glance, it seems that the numbers in the original function (the
2, 3, and 5) have been rearranged almost at random.</p>
<p>But with more thought, the solution becomes very intuitive. The original function f (x) described the
following process: double a number, then subtract 3, then divide by 5. To reverse this process, we need
to reverse each step in order: multiply by 5, then add 3, then divide by 2. This is just what the inverse
function does.</p>

<p><b>1.13.4 Some functions have no inverse function</b></p>
<p>Some functions have no inverse function. The reason is the rule of consistency.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the function y = x2. This function takes both 3 and –3 and turns them into 9. No
problem: a function is allowed to turn different inputs into the same output. However, what does that say
about the inverse of this particular function? In order to fulfill the requirement of an inverse function, it
would have to take 9, and turn it into both 3 and –3—which is the one and only thing that functions are not
allowed to do. Hence, the inverse of this function would not be a function at all!</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>3 !
??3 !</td>
    <td>PICTURE</td> 
    <td>9 !
9 !</td>
  </tr>
  
</table></p>

<p>Table 1.22: If 3 goes in, 9 comes out. If –3 goes in, 9 also comes out. No problem:</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>9 !
9 !</td>
    <td>PICTURE</td> 
    <td>3 !
??3 !</td>
  </tr>
  
</table></p>

<p>Table 1.23: But its inverse would have to turn 9 into both 3 and –3. No function can do this, so there is no
inverse.</p>
</p>In general, any function that turns multiple inputs into the same output, does not have an inverse function.</p>
<p>What does that mean in the real world? If we can convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, we must be able to convert
Celsius to Fahrenheit. If we can ask “How much money did Alice make in 3 days?” we must surely be
able to ask “How long did it take Alice to make $500?” When would you have a function that cannot be
inverted?</p>
<p>Let’s go back to this example:</p>
<p>Recall the example that was used earlier: “Max threw a ball. The height of the ball depends on how many
seconds it has been in the air.” The two variables here are h (the height of the ball) and t (the number of
seconds it has been in the air). The function h (t) enables us to answer questions such as “After 3 seconds,
where is the ball?”</p>
<p>The inverse question would be “At what time was the ball 10 feet in the air?” The problem with that
question is, it may well have two answers!</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>The ball is here...</td>
    <td>...after this much time has elapsed</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10 ft</td>
    <td>2 seconds (*on the way up)</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10 ft</td>
    <td>5 seconds (*on the way back down)</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>
<p>So what does that mean? Does it mean we can’t ask that question? Of course not. We can ask that question,
and we can expect to mathematically find the answer, or answers—and we will do so in the quadratic
chapter. However, it does mean that time is not a function of height because such a “function” would not
be consistent: one question would produce multiple answers.</p>
