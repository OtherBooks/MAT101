<p>1.11 Lines</p>
<p>Most students entering Algebra II are already familiar with the basic mechanics of graphing lines. Recapping
very briefly: the equation for a line is y = mx + b where b is the y-intercept (the place where the line
crosses the y-axis) andmis the slope. If a linear equation is given in another form (for instance, 4x+2y = 5),
the easiest way to graph it is to rewrite it in y = mx + b form (in this case, y = ??2x + 21
2 ).</p>
<p>There are two purposes of reintroducing this material in Algebra II. The first is to frame the discussion as
linear functions modeling behavior. The second is to deepen your understanding of the important concept
of slope.</p>
<p>Consider the following examples. Sam is a salesman—he earns a commission for each sale. Alice is a
technical support representative—she earns $100 each day. The chart below shows their bank accounts
over the week.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>After this many days (t)</td>
    <td>Sam’s bank account (S)</td> 
    <td>Alice’s bank account (A)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0 (*what they started with)</td>
    <td>$75</td> 
    <td>$750</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>$275</td> 
    <td>$850</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>$375</td> 
    <td>$950</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>$450</td> 
    <td>$1,050</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>$480</td> 
    <td>$1,150</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>$530</td> 
    <td>$1,250</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Sam has some extremely good days (such as the first day, when he made $200) and some extremely bad
days (such as the second day, when he made nothing). Alice makes exactly $100 every day.</p>
<p>Let d be the number of days, S be the number of dollars Sam has made, and A be the number of dollars
Alice has made. Both S and A are functions of time. But s (t) is not a linear function, and A (t)is a linear
function.</p>
<p>Definition 1.4: Linear Function</p>
<p>A function is said to be “linear” if every time the independent variable increases by 1, the dependent
variable increases or decreases by the same amount.</p>
<p>Once you know that Alice’s bank account function is linear, there are only two things you need to know
before you can predict her bank account on any given day.</p>
<p>How much money she started with ($750 in this example). This is called the y-intercept.</p>
<p>How much she makes each day ($100 in this example). This is called the slope.</p>
<p>y-intercept is relatively easy to understand. Verbally, it is where the function starts; graphically, it is where
the line crosses the y-axis.</p>
<p>But what about slope? One of the best ways to understand the idea of slope is to convince yourself that all
of the following definitions of slope are actually the same.</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Definitions of Slope</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In our example</td>
    <td>In general</td> 
    <td>On a graph</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Each day, Alice’s bank account
increases by 100. So the slope is
100.</td>
    <td>Each time the independent variable
increases by 1, the dependent
variable increases by the
slope.</td> 
    <td>Each time you move to the right
by 1, the graph goes up by the
slope.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Between days 2 and 5, Alice
earns $300 in 3 days.
300/3=100.Between days 1
and 3, she earns $200 in 2 days.
200/2=100.</td>
    <td>Take any two points. The change
in the dependent variable, divided
by the change in the independent
variable, is the slope.</td> 
    <td>Take any two points. The change
in y divided by the change in x is
the slope. This is often written as
Dy
Dx , or as rise
run</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>The higher the slope, the faster
Alice is making moey.</td>
    <td>The higher the slope, the
faster the dependent variable
increases.</td> 
    <td>The higher the slope, the faster
the graph rises as you move to
the right.</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>So slope does not tell you where a graph is, but how quickly it is rising. Looking at a graph, you can get an
approximate feeling for its slope without any numbers. Examples are given below.</p>
