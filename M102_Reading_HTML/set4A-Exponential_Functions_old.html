<p><b><h1>Exponents</h1></b></p>

<p><b><h2>4A.1 Exponent Concepts</h2></b></p>

<p>An exponent means repeated multiplication. For instance, $10^6$ means $10$ . $10$ .$10$ . $10$ . $10$ . $10$, or $1,000,000$.
You’ve probably noticed that there is a logical progression of operations. When you <b>add the same number
repeatedly</b>, that’s multiplication. When you <b>multiply the same number repeatedly</b>, that’s an exponent.
However, there is one vital difference: addition and multiplication <b>commute</b>, but exponentiation does not
commute. This is a fancy way of saying that order matters. $2 + 3 = 3 + 2$; and $2 . 3 = 3 . 2$, but $2^3$ is not the
same as $3^2$.</p>


<p><b><h2>4A.2 Laws of Exponents</h2></b></p>

</p>The following are generally referred to as the “laws” or “rules” of exponents.</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$x^ax^b = x^{a+b}$</td>
     
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}$ or
$\frac{1}{x^{b-a}}$</td>
     
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>${(x^a)}^b = x^{ab}$</td>
     
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>As with any formula, the most important thing is to be able to use them—that is, to understand what they
mean. But it is also important to know <b>where these formulae come from</b>. And finally, in this case, the three
should be memorized.</p>
<p>So...what do they mean? They are, of course, algebraic generalizations—statements that are true for any $x$,
$a$, and $b$ values. For instance, the first rule tells us that:</p>

<p>$7^{12} . 7^4 = 7^{16}$</p>

<p>which you can confirm on your calculator. Similarly, the third rule promises us that</p>

<p>${7^{12}}^4
= 7^{48}$</p>

<p>These rules can be used to combine and simplify expressions.</p>

<p><b>Example 4A-1:</b></p>

<p>Simplifying with the Rules of Exponents</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$\frac{{(x^3)}^4 . x^5}{x^9 . x^{11}}$</td>
    <td></td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$=\frac{x^{12} . x^5}{x^9 . x^{11}}$</td>
    <td>Third rule: ${(x^a)}^b = x^{ab}$, where $a = 3$ and $b = 4$</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$=\frac{x^{17}}{x^{20}}$</td>
    <td>First rule: $x^ax^b = x^{a+b}$, done on both the top and bottom</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$=\frac{1}{x^3}$</td>
    <td>Second rule: $\frac{x^a}{x^b}=\frac{1}{x^{b-a}}$, where we choose this form to avoid a negative exponent</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>Why do these rules work? It’s very easy to see, based on what an exponent is.</p>

<p>Why does the first rule work?</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>$19^3$</td>
    <td>$19^4$</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$= (19 . 19 . 19)$</td>
    <td>$(19 . 19 . 19 . 19)$</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
<tr>
    <td>$= 19^7$</td>
    <td></td> 
    
  </tr>
  
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>You see what happened? $19^3$ means three 19s multiplied; $19^4$ means four 19s multiplied. Multiply them
together, and you get seven 19s multiplied.</p>

<p>Why does the second rule work?</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>First form</td>
    <td>Second form</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>$\frac{19^8}{19^5}$</td>
    <td>$\frac{19^5}{19^ }$</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>= 1919191919191919
1919191919</td>
    <td>= 1919191919
1919191919191919</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>IMAGE</td>
    <td>IMAGE</td> 
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>= 193</td>
    <td>= 1
193</td> 
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>In this case, the key is fraction cancellations. When the top is multiplied by 19 and the bottom is multiplied
by 19, canceling these 19s has the effect of dividing the top and bottom by 19. When you divide the top
and bottom of a fraction by the same number, the fraction is unchanged.</p>
<p>You can also think of this rule as the inevitable consequence of the first rule. If 193  195 = 198, then 198
195
(which asks the question “ 195 times what equals 198?”) must be 193.</p>

<p>Why does the third rule work?</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>193
4</td>
    <td>= (19  19  19)  (19  19  19)  (19  19  19)  (19  19  19)</td> 
    <td>= 1912</td>
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>What does it mean to raise something to the fourth power? It means to multiply it by itself, four times.
In this case, what we are multiplying by itself four times is 193, or (19  19  19). Three 19s multiplied four
times makes twelve 19s multiplied.</p>

<p>Zero, Negative Numbers, and Fractions as Exponents</p>

<p>The definition of exponents given at the beginning of this section— 106means 10  10  10  10  10  10—does
not enable us to answer questions such as:</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>40 =?</td>
    <td>5??4 =?</td> 
    <td>912
=?</td>
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>
You can’t “multiply 9 by itself half a time” or “multiply 5 by itself ??4 times.” In general, the original
definition only applies if the exponent is a positive integer.
</p>


<p>
It’s very important to understand this point. The question is not “What answer does our original definition
give in these cases?” The original definition does not give any answer in these cases. If we want to include
these numbers, we need a whole new definition of what an exponent is.
</p>


<p>
In principle, many such definitions are possible. We could define 5??4 as 5/5/5/5: in other words, divide
four times instead of multiplying four times. Or we could define 5??4as 5??4: take 5 to the fourth power,
and then multiply it by ??1. Or we could define 5??4 as ??(5)4: take ??5 to the fourth power (which gives a
different answer from the previous definition). It seems at first that we are at liberty to choose any definition
we want.
</p>


<p>
Given that degree of freedom, you may be very surprised at the definitions that are actually used: they
seem far more arbitrary and complicated than some others you could come up with.
</p>

<p>Definitions: When the exponent is not a positive integer</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Zero exponents</td>
    <td>Negative exponents</td>
    <td>Fractional exponents
(numerator = 1)</td> 
    <td>Fractional exponents
(numerator 6= 1)</td>  
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Always 1</td>

    <td>Order doesn’t matter!</td>  
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x0 = 1</td>
    <td>1
5??3 = 53</td>
    <td>813

8 = 2</td> 
    <td>3 p

83 or

3</td>  
    
  </tr>

  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>Note that you can combine these definitions. For instance, 8??2
3 is a negative, fractional exponent. The
negative exponent means, as always, “put me in the denominator.” So we can write:</p>

<p>8??2
3 = 1
823
= 1
3 p
82
= 1
4</p>


<p>OK, so why define exponents that way?</p>
<p>These are obviously not chosen to be the simplest possible definitions. But they are chosen to be consistent
with the behavior of positive-integer exponents.</p>
<p>One way to see that consistency is to consider the following progression:</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>194 = 19  19  19  19</td>
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>193 = 19  19  19</td>
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>192 = 19  19</td>
    
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>191 = 19</td>
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>


<p>What happens each time we decrease the exponent by 1? Your first response might be “we have one less
19.” But what is really happening, mathematically, to the numbers on the right? The answer is that, with
each step, they are dividing by 19. If you take 19  19  19  19, and divide it by 19, you get 19  19  19. Divide
that by 19 again, and you get 19  19...and so on. From this we can formulate the following principle for the
powers of 19:</p>
<p>Whenever you subtract 1 from the exponent, you divide the answer by 19.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, we want the behavior of our new exponents to be consistent with the behavior of the old
(positive-integer) exponents. So we can continue this progression as follows:</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>190 = 19
19
= 1</td>
     
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>19??1 = 1
19</td>
     
    
  </tr>
  
<tr>
    <td>19??2 =
1
19
19
= 1
192</td>
     
    
  </tr>
  
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>

<p>by simply requiring this progression to be consistent.</p>
<p>More rigorously, we can find all our exponent definitions by using the laws of exponents. For instance,
what is 40? We can approach this question indirectly by asking: what is 42
42 ?</p>
<p> The second law of exponents tells us that 42
42 = 42??2, which is of course 40.
 But of course, 42
42 is just 16
16 , or 1.
 Since 42
42 is both 40and 1, 40 and 1 must be the same thing!</p>
<p>The proofs given below all follow this pattern. They use the laws of exponents to rewrite expressions such
as 42
42 , and go on to show how zero, negative, and fractional exponents must be defined. We started with
the definition of an exponent for a positive integer, 106 = 10  10  10  10  10  10. From there, we developed
the laws of exponents. Now we find that, if we want those same laws to apply to other kinds of exponents,
there is only one correct way to define those other kinds of exponents.</p>

<p>You may want to experiment with making these proofs more general and more rigorous by using letters
instead of numbers. For instance, in the third case, we could write:</p>

    <td>x1a
a
= x(1a
)(a) = x1</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>a q
(x)a = a p

  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>x1a
= a p
x</td>
    
    
  </tr>
  
 
</table>

</p>


</p>Exponential Curves
</p>







<p>By plotting points, you can discover that the graph of y = 2x looks like this:</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>A few points to notice about this graph.</p>
<p> It goes through the point (0, 1) because 20 = 1.
 It never dips below the x-axis. The domain is unlimited, but the range is y>0. (*Think about our
definitions of exponents: whether x is positive or negative, integer or fraction, 2x is always positive.)
 Every time you move one unit to the right, the graph height doubles. For instance, 25 is twice 24,
because it multiplies by one more 2. So as you move to the right, the y-values start looking like 8, 16,
32, 64, 128, and so on, going up more and more sharply.
 Conversely, every time you move one unit to the left, the graph height drops in half. So as you move
to the left, the y-values start looking like 1
2 , 14
, 18
, and so on, falling closer and closer to 0.</p>
<p>What would the graph of y = 3x look like? Of course, it would also go through (0, 1) because 30 = 1. With
each step to the right, it would triple; with each step to the left, it would drop in a third. So the overall
shape would look similar, but the rise (on the right) and the drop (on the left) would be faster.</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>As you might guess, graphs such as 5x and 10x all have this same characteristic shape. In fact, any graph ax
where a > 1 will look basically the same: starting at (0, 1) it will rise more and more sharply on the right,
and drop toward zero on the left. This type of graph models exponential growth—functions that keep
multiplying by the same number. A common example, which you work through in the text, is compound
interest from a bank.</p>
<p>The opposite graph is

1
2
x
.</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>Each time you move to the right on this graph, it multiplies by 12
: in other words, it divides by 2, heading
closer to zero the further you go. This kind of equation is used to model functions that keep dividing by
the same number; for instance, radioactive decay. You will also be working through examples like this one.</p>
<p>Of course, all the permutations from the first chapter on “functions” apply to these graphs just as they
apply to any graph. A particularly interesting example is 2??x. Remember that when you replace x with
??x, f (3) becomes the old f (??3) and vice-versa; in other words, the graph flips around the y-axis. If you
take the graph of 2x and permute it in this way, you get a familiar shape:</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>Yes, it’s

12
x
in a new disguise!</p>
<p>Why did it happen that way? Consider that

1
2
x
= 1x
2x . But 1x is just 1 (in other words, 1 to the anything is
1), so

12
x
= 1
2x . But negative exponents go in the denominator: 1
2x is the same thing as 2??x! So we arrive
at:

1
2
x
= 2??x. The two functions are the same, so their graphs are of course the same.</p>
<p>Another fun pair of permutations is:</p>
<p>y = 2  2x Looks just like y = 2x but vertically stretched: all y-values double</p>
<p>y = 2x+1 Looks just like y = 2x but horizontally shifted: moves 1 to the left</p>
<p>If you permute 2x in these two ways, you will find that they create the same graph.</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>Once again, this is predictable from the rules of exponents: 2  2x = 21  2x = 2x+1</p>
<p>Using exponential functions to model behavior</p>
<p>In the first chapter, we talked about linear functions as functions that add the same amount every time.
For instance, y = 3x + 4 models a function that starts at 4; every time you increase x by 1, you add 3 to y.</p>
<p>Exponential functions are conceptually very analogous: they multiply by the same amount every time.
For instance, y = 4  3x models a function that starts at 4; every time you increase x by 1, you multiplyy
by 3.</p>
<p>Linear functions can go down, as well as up, by having negative slopes: y = ??3x + 4 starts at 4 and
subtracts 3 every time. Exponential functions can go down, as well as up, by having fractional bases:</p>
<p>y = 4 

1
3
x
starts at 4 and divides by 3 every time.</p>
<p>Exponential functions often defy intuition, because they grow much faster than people expect.</p>
<p>Modeling exponential functions</p>
<p>Your father’s house was worth $100,000 when he bought it in 1981. Assuming that it increases in value
by 8% every year, what was the house worth in the year 2001? (*Before you work through the math, you may want to make an intuitive guess as to what you think the house is worth. Then, after we crunch the
numbers, you can check to see how close you got.)</p>
<p>Often, the best way to approach this kind of problem is to begin by making a chart, to get a sense of the
growth pattern.</p>

<p><center>

<table class = "center">

  <tr>
    <td>Year</td>
    <td>Increase in Value</td> 
    <td>Value</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>1981</td>
    <td>N/A</td> 
    <td>100,000</td>
  </tr>
  
 <tr>
    <td>1982</td>
    <td>8% of 100,000 = 8,000</td> 
    <td>108,000</td>
  </tr>
  
 <tr>
    <td>1983</td>
    <td>8% of 108,000 = 8,640</td> 
    <td>116,640</td>
  </tr>
  
 <tr>
    <td>1984</td>
    <td>8% of 116,640 = 9,331</td> 
    <td>125,971</td>
  </tr>
  
  
 
</table>

</center>
</p>



<p>Before you go farther, make sure you understand where the numbers on that chart come from. It’s OK to
use a calculator. But if you blindly follow the numbers without understanding the calculations, the whole
rest of this section will be lost on you.
</p>

<p>In order to find the pattern, look at the “Value” column and ask: what is happening to these numbers every
time? Of course, we are adding 8% each time, but what does that really mean? With a little thought—or by
looking at the numbers—you should be able to convince yourself that the numbers are multiplying by 1.08
each time. That’s why this is an exponential function: the value of the house multiplies by 1.08 every year.
</p>

<p>So let’s make that chart again, in light of this new insight. Note that I can now skip the middle column and
go straight to the answer we want. More importantly, note that I am not going to use my calculator this
time—I don’t want to multiply all those 1.08s, I just want to note each time that the answer is 1.08 times the
previous answer.

<p>If you are not clear where those numbers came from, think again about the conclusion we reached earlier:
each year, the value multiplies by 1.08. So if the house is worth 100, 000  1.082in 1983, then its value in
1984 is

100, 000  1.082

 1.08, which is 100, 000  1.083.
</p>

<p>Once we write it this way, the pattern is clear. I have expressed that pattern by adding the last row, the
value of the house in any year y. And what is the mystery exponent? We see that the exponent is 1 in 1982,
2 in 1983, 3 in 1984, and so on. In the year y, the exponent is y ?? 1981
</p>.

<p>So we have our house value function:</p>
<p>v (y) = 100, 000  1.08y??1981</p>

<p>That is the pattern we needed in order to answer the question. So in the year 2001, the value of the house
is 100, 000  1.0820. Bringing the calculator back, we find that the value of the house is now $466,095 and
change.</p>
<p>Wow! The house is over four times its original value! That’s what I mean about exponential functions
growing faster than you expect: they start out slow, but given time, they explode. This is also a practical life
lesson about the importance of saving money early in life—a lesson that many people don’t realize until
it’s too late.</p>
