<h1><b>4B: Logarithm Rules</b></h1>

<b>Objectives:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Expand logarithmic expressions using the rules of logarithms.</li>
  <li>Combine logarithmic expressions using the rules of logarithms.</li>

</ul>

<p>
In Module <b>4A-Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</b>, we introduced the logarithmic functions as inverses of exponential functions and discussed a few of their functional properties from that perspective. In this module, we explore the algebraic properties (or rules) of logarithms. Historically, these have played a huge role in the scientific development of our society since, among other things, they were used to develop analog computing devices called <i>slide rules</i> which enabled scientists and engineers to perform accurate calculations leading to such things as space travel and the moon landing. As we shall see shortly, logs have properties similar to all of the properties of exponents. We first restate the definition of a logarithm and the fact that it is the inverse of an exponential function.
</p>
<p>
<b>Definition of Logarithm:</b>  Let $b >0$ with $b \neq 1$. If $a$ and $c$ are numbers
<ul>
  <li>  $\log_b(c) = a$ means $b^a = c$</li>
  <li> $\log_b(b^x) = x$ for all $x$ and $b^{\log_b(x)} = x$ for all $x \gt 0$</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><b>A few quick examples to review logarithms:</b></h3>

<h3><b>Review the graph of a logarithm function</b></h3>
The graph of any logarithm function with base greater than $1$ has the same basic shape.  We plot
a few well chosen points to graph $f(x) = \log_2(x)$:
 <p><center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table  id="collapseborder">
        <tr>
        <td  id="collapseborder">$x$</td>
        <td  id="collapseborder" align="center">$y = \log_2(x)$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td  id="collapseborder">$\frac{1}{8}$</td>
        <td  id="collapseborder" align="center">-3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td  id="collapseborder">$\frac{1}{4}$</td>
       <td  id="collapseborder" align="center">$-2$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td  id="collapseborder">$\frac{1}{2}$</td>
       <td  id="collapseborder" align="center">$-1$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td  id="collapseborder">1</td>
       <td  id="collapseborder" align="center">0</td>
       </tr>
        <tr>
        <td  id="collapseborder">2</td>
        <td  id="collapseborder" align="center">1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td  id="collapseborder">4</td>
        <td  id="collapseborder" align="center">2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td  id="collapseborder">8</td>
        <td  id="collapseborder" align="center">3</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
   </td>
    <td> <img src="set4B-Logarithm_Rules_01.png" width="50%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
As always, you can learn a great deal about the log function by reading the graph.
<ul>
  <li> The domain is $x \gt 0.$ (You can't take the log of $0$ or a negative number—do you remember why?).</li>
  <li> The range, on the other hand, is all numbers. Of course, all this inverses the function $2^x$, which has a
domain of all numbers and a range of $y \gt 0.$</li>
  <li> As $x$ gets closer and closer to $0,$ the function dives down to smaller and smaller negative numbers. So
the $y$-axis serves as an "asymptote" for the graph, meaning a line that the graph approaches closer
and closer as a guiding line.</li>
  <li> As $x$ moves to the right, the graph grows—but more and more slowly. As $x$ goes from $4$ to $8,$ the graph
goes up by $1.$ As $x$ goes from $8$ to $16,$ the graph goes up by another $1.$ It doesn't make it up another $1$
until $x$ reaches $32$ .... and so on.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Using the log to model a real world problem</b></p>
<p>This pattern of slower and slower growth is one of the most important characteristics of the log. It can be
used to "slow down" functions that have too wide a range to be practical to work with.

<p> Using the log to model a real world problem
Lewis Fry Richardson (1881–1953) was a British meteorologist and mathematician. He was also an
active Quaker and committed pacifist, and was one of the first men to apply statistics to the study
of human conflict. Richardson catalogued $315$ wars between 1820 and 1950, and categorized them
by how many deaths they caused. At one end of the scale is a deadly quarrel, which might result
in $1$ or $2$ deaths. At the other extreme are World War I and World War II, which are responsible for
roughly $10$ million deaths each.</p>

<p>As you can see from the chart above, working with these numbers is extremely difficult: on a
scale from $0$ to $10$ Million, there is no visible difference between (say) 1 and 100,000. Richardson
solved this problem by taking the common log of the number of deaths. So a conflict with 1,000
deaths is given a magnitude of $\log(1000) = 3.$ On this scale, which is now the standard for conflict
measurement, the magnitudes of all wars can be easily represented.

<p><center><img src="set4B-Logarithm_Rules_03.png" width="30%"></center></p>
<p>Richardson's scale makes it practical to chart, discuss, and compare wars and battles from the
smallest to the biggest. For instance, he discovered that each time you move up by one on the
scale—that is, each time the number of deaths multiplies by $10$—the number of conflicts drops by
a third. (So there are roughly three times as many "magnitude $5$" wars as "magnitude $6$," and so
on.)</p>
<p>The log is useful here because the logarithm function itself grows so slowly that it compresses
the entire 1 to 10,000,000 range into a $0$ to $7$ scale. The same trick is
used—for the same reason—to study topics ranging from earthquakes to sound waves.</p>
</p>

<h2><b>$\S$4B.1 Rules of Logarithms</b></h2>
<p>Just as there are fundamental rules of exponents, there are corresponding fundamental rules of logarithms.</p>
<p>
For $b>0$, $b \neq 1$ and real numbers $m$, $n$, $M$ and $N$, the exponent and logarithm rules are:
<table width="85" align="center" id="collapseborder">

  <td style="white-space: nowrap"  id="collapseborder">Rules for Exponents:</td>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap">Rules for Logarithms:</td>
 </tr>

   <td id="collapseborder"> Product Rule </td>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap">$b^m b^n = b^{m+n}$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr  id="collapseborder">
  <td id="collapseborder"> Quotient Rule </td>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap">$\dfrac{b^m}{b^n} = b^{m-n}$</td>
  <td id="collapseborder"> $\log_b \dfrac{M}{N} = \log_b M - \log_b N$</td>
    </tr>
  <tr  id="collapseborder">
     <td id="collapseborder"> Power Rule </td>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap">$(b^m)^n = b^{mn}$</td>
  <td id="collapseborder"> $\log_b M^n= n\log_b M$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="collapseborder">
  <td id="collapseborder"> Zero Rule </td>
  <td style="white-space: nowrap">$b^0 = 1$</td>
  <td  id="collapseborder"> $\log_b(1) = 0$</td>
</tr>
</table>

</p>


<p><b>Example 4B-1: Properties of Logarithms</b></p>
<p>  Suppose you are given these two facts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$\log_4 5 = 1.16$</li>
  <li>$\log_4 10 = 1.66$</li>
</ul>


<p>Then we can use the laws of logarithms to conclude that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$\log_4 (50) = \log_4 5 + \log_4 10 = 1.16 + 1.66 = 2.82$</li>
  <li>$\log_4 (2) = \log_4 10 - \log_4 5 = 1.66 - 1.16 = 0.5$</li>
  <li>$\log_4 (100,000) = 5\log_4 10 = 5(1.66) = 8.3$</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: All three of these above results can be found quickly, and without a calculator. Note that the
second result could also be figured out directly, since $4^{1/2} = 2.$</p>
<p>These rules of logarithms were very important historically, because they enabled pre-calculator mathematicians
to perform multiplication (which is very time-consuming and error prone) by doing addition
(which is faster and easier). These rules are still useful in simplifying complicated expressions and solving
equations and we will explore these uses in the next module. The logarithm rules may seem a bit
strange, but they come about because of the way exponents behave.</p>


<p><h2>$\S$4B.2 Proving the Rules of Logarithms</h2></p>
<p>If you understand what an exponent is, you can very quickly see why the rules of exponents work.
But why do logarithms have the rules we listed above?</p>
<p>As you work through the text, you will demonstrate these rules intuitively, by viewing the logarithm as a
counter. ( $\log_2 8$ asks "how many $2$s do I need to multiply, in order to get $8$?") However, these rules can also
be rigorously proven, using the rules of exponents as our starting place.</p>

<p>Proving the Product Rule of Logarithms, $\log_b (MN) = \log_b M + \log_b N$</p>
<p><center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align = "right">$c = \log_b M$</td>
    <td>I'm just inventing $c$ to represent this log</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align ="right">$b^c = M$</td>
    <td>Rewriting the above expression as an exponent.
( $\log_b M$ asks "$b$ to what power is $M$?" And the
equation answers: "$b$ to the $c$ is $M$.')</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align = "right">$d = \log_b N$</td>
    <td>Similarly, $d$ will represent the other log.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align = "right">$b^d = N$</td>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align = "right">$\log_b (MN) = \log_b (b^c b^d)$</td>
    <td>Replacing $M$ and $N$ based on the previous equations</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align = "right">$= \log_b (b^{c+d})$</td>
    <td>This is the key step! It uses the first rule of exponents.
Thus you can see that the rules of
logarithms come directly from the rules of exponents.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align = "right">$= c + d$</td>
    <td>$\log_b (b^{c+d})$ asks the question: "$b$ to what
power is $b^{c+d}$ ?" Looked at this way, the answer
is obviously $(c+d)$ . Hence, you can see how
the logarithm and exponential functions cancel
each other out, as inverse functions must.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align = "right">$= \log_b M + \log_b N$</td>
    <td>Replacing $c$ and $d$ with what they were originally
defined as. Hence, we have proven what we
set out to prove.</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<p>To test your understanding, try proving the Quotient Rule of logarithms: the proof is very similar to the proof
just given above.
For the Power Rule, you need invent only one variable, $f = \log_b M$. In each case, you will rely on a different
one of the rules of exponents, showing how each exponent rule corresponds to one of the logarithms
rules.</p>

<p><h2>$\S$4B.3 Working with the Properties of Logarithms</h2></p>
The following examples help build familiarity with using the the log rules.

<p><b>Example 4B-2:</b> Expand the following using the rules of logarithms and simplify. Assume
when necessary that all quantities represent positive real numbers.
<ol  type="a">
  <li> $\log_2\left( \dfrac{8}{x}\right)$
  </br>
  Solution: To expand $\log_2\left( \frac{8}{x}\right)$, we use the Quotient Rule
  <table width="75" align="center">
  <tr>
  <td align="right" style="white-space: nowrap"> $\log_2\left( \dfrac{8}{x}\right)$</td>

  <tr>
  <td> </td>
  <td align="left" style="white-space: nowrap">$ = 3 - \log_2(x)$</td>

</tr>
  </table>
</br> </br>
  </li>
  <li> $\ln (x^2y)$
  </br>
  Solution: To expand this expression, we need both the Product Rule and the Power Rule:
    <table width="75" align="center">
  <tr>
  <td align="right" style="white-space: nowrap"> $\ln (x^2y)$</td>
  <td align="left" style="white-space: nowrap"> $ = \ln(x^2) + \ln(y)$</td>

  </table>
  </br> </br>
  </li>
  <li> $\log \left( \dfrac{\sqrt{x}}{x+3} \right)$
  </br>
  Solution: The Quotient Rule and Power Rule will do the trick for this one.
      <table width="75" align="center">
  <tr>
  <td align="right" style="white-space: nowrap"> $\log \left( \dfrac{\sqrt{x}}{x+3} \right)$</td>

  <td style="white-space: nowrap">Power Rule</td>

  </table>
  Note that we cannot change $\log(x+3)$ by any log rule since it is not a product nor a quotient.
  </br> </br>
  </li>
  <li> $\log(100A^{0.3}B)$
  </br>

  <li> $\ln(x^2 - 5y)$

  </br> </br>
  </li>
  <li> $\ln(x)\ln(x+1)$
  </br>
  Solution: This expression cannot be combined into one log since it is not a sum or difference
  of two logarithms.
  </br> </br>
  </li>
  <li> $\dfrac{\log(5t)}{\log(t-3)}$
  </br>
  Solution: Like the previous example, this expression cannot be combined into
  one logarithm since it is not the sum or difference of two logarithms.
  </br> </br>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Example 4B-4:</b> In the western United States the area $A$ (in $\mbox{mi}^2$)
affected by an earthquake is related to the magnitude $R$ of the quake by the formula:
$$R = 2.3 \log(A + 3000) - 5.1$$
</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> If $5 \mbox{ mi}^2$ of land are affected by an earthquake, what was the magnitude of the quake?
  </br>
  Solution: Use $A = 5$ in the formula to find $R$:
         $$ \begin{align}
         R  & = 2.3 \log(5 + 3000) - 5.1 \\
           & = 2.3 \log(3005) - 5.1 \\

           & \approx 2.89903 \\
         \end{align}$$
  $R$ is about a magnitude $3$ earthquake.
  </br> </br>
  </li>
  <li> How many square miles will be affected if a magnitude $5$ earthquake hits?
  </br>
  Solution: This time we know $R$  but not $A$.
           $$ \begin{align}

           A + 3000 & = 10^{10.1/2.3} &  & \\
           A  & =10^{10.1/2.3} - 3000 & \\
