<p><b>2.2 Absolute Value Equations</b></p>
<p>Absolute value is one of the simplest functions—and paradoxically, one of the most problematic.</p>
<p>On the face of it, nothing could be simpler: it just means “whatever comes in, a positive number comes
out.”</p>
<p>j 5 j= 5</p>
<p>j ??5 j= 5</p>
<p>Absolute values seem to give us permission to ignore the whole nasty world of negative numbers and
return to the second grade when all numbers were positive.</p>
<p>But consider these three equations. They look very similar—only the number changes—but the solutions
are completely different.</p>
<p>Three Simple Absolute Value Equations</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>| x |= 10</td>
    <td>| x |= ??10</td> 
    <td>| x |= 0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x = 10 works.</td>
    <td>x = 10 doesn’t work.</td> 
    <td>x = 0 is the only solution.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Hey, so does x = ??10!</td>
    <td>Neither does x = ??10.</td> 
    <td></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Concisely, x = 10.</td>
    <td>Hey...absolute values are never negative!</td> 
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>We see that the first problem has two solutions, the second problem has no solutions, and the third problem
has one solution. This gives you an example of how things can get confusing with absolute values—and
how you can solve things if you think more easily than with memorized rules.</p>
<p>For more complicated problems, follow a three-step approach.</p>
<p>1. Do the algebra to isolate the absolute value.</p>
<p>2. Then, think it through like the simpler problems above.</p>
<p>3. Finally, do more algebra to isolate x.</p>
<p>In my experience, most problems with this type of equation do not occur in the first and third step. And
they do not occur because students try to think it through (second step) and don’t think it through correctly.
They occur because students try to take “shortcuts” to avoid the second step entirely.</p>
<p>Example 2.1: Absolute Value Equation (No Variable on the Other Side)</p>
<p>3 j 2 x + 1 j ?? 7 = 5</p>
<p>Step 1:: Algebraically isolate the absolute value</p>
</p>3 j 2 x + 1 j = 12</br>
j 2 x + 1 j = 4</p>
<p>Step 2:: Think!</p>
<p>For the moment, forget about the quantity 2 x + 1; just think of it as something.
The absolute value of “something” is 4. So, in analogy to what we did before, the
“something” can either be 4, or –4. So that gives us two possibilities...</p>

</p>2x + 1 = 4</br>
2x + 1 = ??4</p>
<p>Step 3:: Algebraically solve (both equations) for x</p>
<p>2 x = 3 or 2 x = ??5</br>
x = 3/
2 or x = ??52</p>
<p>So this problem has two answers: x = 3/2
and x = ??5/
2</p>
<p>Example 2.2: Absolute Value Equation (No Variable on the Other Side)</p>
<p>6jx??2j
5 + 7 = 4</p>
<p>Step 1: Algebraically isolate the absolute value:</p>
<p>6|x ?? 2|
5
= ??3</p>
<p>6jx ?? 2j = ??15</p>
<p>|x ?? 2j = ??15
6
= ??5/
2</p>

<p>Step 2: Think!: The absolute value of “something” is ??21
2 . But wait—absolute values are never
negative! It can’t happen! So we don’t even need a third step in this case: the equation is
impossible.</p>
<p>No solution.</p>
<p>The “think” step in the above examples was relatively straightforward, because there were no variables on
the right side of the equation. When there are variables on the right side, you temporarily “pretend” that
the right side of the equation is a positive number, and break the equation up accordingly. However, there
is a price to be paid for this slight of hand: you have to check your answers, because they may not work
even if you do your math correctly.</p>
<p>Example 2.3: Absolute Value Equation with Variables on Both Sides</p>
<p>| 2x + 3 |= ??11x + 42</p>
<p>We begin by approaching this in analogy to the first problem above, j x j= 10. We saw that x
could be either 10, or –10. So we will assume in this case that 2x +3 can be either ??11x +42 , or
the negative of that, and solve both equations.</p>
<p>Problem One</p>
<p>2x + 3 = ??11x + 42</br>
13x + 3 = 42</br>
13x = 39</br>
x = 3</p>
<p>Problem Two</p>

<p>2x + 3 = ??(??11x + 42)</p>
<p>2x + 3 = 11x ?? 42</p>
<p>??9x + 3 = ??42</p>
<p>??9x = ??45</p>
<p>x = 5</p>
<p>So we have two solutions: x = 3 and x = 5. Do they both work? Let’s try them both.</p>
<p>Problem One</p>
<p>1. | 2 (3) + 3 |= ??11 (3) + 42.</p>
<p>| 9 |= 9. X</p>
<p>Problem Two</p>
<p>1. | 2 (5) + 3 |= ??11 (5) + 42.</p>
</p>| 13 |= ??13. </p>
<p>We see in this case that the first solution, x = 3, worked; the second, x = 5, did not. So the only solution to
this problem is x = 3.</p>
<p>However, there was no way of knowing that in advance. For such problems, the only approach is to solve
them twice, and then test both answers. In some cases, both will work; in some cases, neither will work. In
some cases, as in this one, one will work and the other will not.</p>
<p>HARD AND FAST RULE: Whenever an absolute value equation has variables on both sides, you
have to check your answer(s). Even if you do all the math perfectly, your answer(s) may not work.</p>
<p>OK, why is that? Why can you do all the math right and still get a wrong answer?</p>
<p>Remember that the problem j x j= 10 has two solutions, and j x j= ??10 has none. We started with the
problem j 2x + 3 j= ??11x + 42. OK, which is that like? Is the right side of the equation like 10 or –10? If
you think about it, you can convince yourself that it depends on what x is. After you solve, you may wind
up with an x-value that makes the right side positive; that will work. Or, you may wind up with an x-value
that makes the right side negative; that won’t work. But you can’t know until you get there.</p>
<p><b>2.3 Absolute Value Inequalities</b></p>
<p>Here’s one of my favorite problems:</p>
<p>| x |< 10</p>
<p>Having seen that the solution to | x |= 10 is | x |= 10, many students answer this question | x |<  10.
However, this is not only wrong: it is, as discussed above, relatively meaningless. In order to approach this
question you have to—you guessed it!—step back and think.</p>
<p>Here are two different, perfectly correct ways to look at this problem.</p>

<p>1. What numbers work? 4 works. –4 does too. 0 works. 13 doesn’t work. How about –13? No: if
x = ??13 then | x |= 13, which is not less than 10. By playing with numbers in this way, you should be
able to convince yourself that the numbers that work must be somewhere between –10 and 10. This
is one way to approach the answer.</p>
<p>2. The other way is to think of absolute value as representing distance from 0. | 5 | and | ??5 | are both
5 because both numbers are 5 away from 0. In this case, | x |< 10 means “the distance between x and
0 is less than 10”—in other words, you are within 10 units of zero in either direction. Once again, we
conclude that the answer must be between –10 and 10.</p>
<p>PICTURE</p>

<p>It is not necessary to use both of these methods; use whichever method is easier for you to understand.</p>
<p>More complicated absolute value problems should be approached in the same three steps as the equations
discussed above: algebraically isolate the absolute value, then think, then algebraically solve for x . However,
as illustrated above, the think step is a bit more complicated with inequalities than with equations.</p>
<p>Example 2.4: Absolute Value Inequality</p>
<p>??3 (| 2x + 3 | ??8) < ?? 15</p>
<p>Step 1:: Algebraically isolate the absolute value</p>
<p>| 2x + 3 | ??8 > 5 (don’t forget to switch the inequality when dividing by –3!)</p>
<p>| 2x + 3 |> 13</p>
<p>Step 2:: Think!</p>
<p>As always, forget the 2x + 3 in this step. The absolute value of something is greater
than 13. What could the something be?</p>
<p>We can approach this in two ways, just as the previous absolute value inequality. The
first method is trying numbers. We discover that all numbers greater than 13 work (such
as 14, 15, 16)—their absolute values are greater than 13. Numbers less than –13 (such as
–14,–15,–16) also have absolute values greater than 13. But in-between numbers, such
as –12, 0, or 12, do not work.</p>
<p>The other approach is to think of absolute value as representing distance to 0. The
distance between something and 0 is greater than 13. So the something is more than 13
away from 0—in either direction.</p>
<p>Either way, we conclude that the something must be anything greater than 13, OR less
than –13!</p>
<p>PICTURE</p>

<p>Step 3:: Algebraically solve (both inequalities) for x</p>
<p>2x + 3 < ?? 13 OR 2x + 3 > 13</p>
<p>2x < ?? 16 OR 2x > 10</p>
<p>x < ?? 8 OR x > 5</p>
<p>PICTURE</p>



<p>Many students will still resist the think step, attempting to figure out “the rules” that will always lead from
the question to the answer. At first, it seems that memorizing a few rules won’t be too hard: “greater-than
problems always lead to OR answers” and that kind of thing. But those rules will fail you when you hit a
problem like the next one.</p>
<p>Example 2.5: Absolute Value Inequality</p>
<p>| x ?? 3 | +10 > 7</p>
<p>Step 1:: Algebraically isolate the absolute value</p>
<p>| x ?? 3 |> ?? 3</p>
<p>Step 2:: Think!</p>
<p>The absolute value of something is greater than –3. What could the something be? 2
works. –2 also works. And 0. And 7. And –10. And...hey! Absolute values are always
positive, so the absolute value of anything is greater than –3!</p>
<p>All numbers work</p>
<p><b>2.4 Graphing Absolute Values</b></p>
<p>You can graph y =| x | easily enough by plotting points. The characteristic V shape is illustrated below,
with a couple of sample points highlighted.</p>
<p>PICTURE</p>
<p>Of course, this shape is subject to the same permutations as any other function! A few examples are given
below.</p>
<p>PICTURES</p>

<p><b>2.5 Graphing Inequalities</b></p>
<p>In general, the graph of an inequality is a shaded area.</p>
<p>Consider the graph y =j x j shown above. Every point on that V-shape has the property that its y-value is
the absolute value of its x-value. For instance, the point (??3, 3) is on the graph because 3 is the absolute
value of –3.</p>
<p>The inequality y < j x j means the y-value is less than the absolute value of the x-value. This will
occur anywhere underneath the above graph. For instance, the point (??3, 1) meets this criterion; the point
(??3, 4) does not. If you think about it, you should be able to convince yourself that all points below the
above graph fit this criterion.</p>
<p>PICTURE</p>

<p>The dotted line indicates that the graph y =j x j is not actually a part of our set. If we were graphing
y j x j the line would be complete, indicating that those points would be part of the set.</p>
<p><b>2.6 "Piecewise Functions" and Absolute Value</b></p>
<p>What do you get if you put a positive number into an absolute value? Answer: you get that same number
back. j 5 j= 5. j p j= p. And so on. We can say, as a generalization, that j x j= x; but only if x is positive.</p>
<p>OK, so, what happens if you put a negative number into an absolute value? Answer: you get that same
number back, but made positive. OK, how do you make a negative number positive? Mathematically, you
multiply it by –1. j ??5 j= ??(??5) = 5. j ??p j= ??(??p) = p. We can say, as a generalization, that
j x j= ??x; but only if x is negative.</p>
<p>So the absolute value function can be defined like this.</p>
<p>The “Piecewise” Definition of Absolute Value</p>
<p>| x |= f</br>
x, x  0</br>
??x, x < 0</p>

<p>If you’ve never seen this before, it looks extremely odd. If you try to pin that feeling down, I think you’ll
find this looks odd for some combination of these three reasons.</p>
<p>1. The whole idea of a “piecewise function”—that is, a function which is defined differently on different
domains—may be unfamiliar. Think about it in terms of the function game. Imagine getting a card
that says “If you are given a positive number or 0, respond with the same number you were given. If
you are given a negative number, multiply it by –1 and give that back.” This is one of those “can a
function do that?” moments. Yes, it can—and, in fact, functions defined in this “piecewise manner”
are more common than you might think.</p>
<p>2. The ??x looks suspicious. “I thought an absolute value could never be negative!” Well, that’s right.
But if x is negative, then ??x is positive. Instead of thinking of the ??x as “negative x” it may help to
think of it as “change the sign of x.”</p>
<p>3. Even if you get past those objections, you may feel that we have taken a perfectly ordinary, easy to
understand function, and redefined it in a terribly complicated way. Why bother?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the piecewise definition makes many problems easier. Let’s consider a few graphing problems.
You already know how to graph y =j x j. But you can explain the V shape very easily with the piecewise
definition. On the right side of the graph (where x  0), it is the graph of y = x. On the left side of the
graph (where x < 0), it is the graph of y = ??x.</p>
<p>GRAPHS</p>
<p>Figure 2.11: (a) y = ?? x The whole graph is shown, but the only part we care about is on the left, where
x < 0 (b) y = x The whole graph is shown, but the only part we care about is on the right, where x  0
(c) y = | x | Created by putting together the relevant parts of the other two graphs</p>

<p>x + j x j = f</br>
x + x = 2x x  0</br>
x + ( ?? x ) = 0 x < 0</p>

<p>So we graph y = 2x on the right, and y = 0 on the left. (You may want to try doing this in three separate
drawings, as I did above.)</p>
<p>GRAPH</p>
<p>Our final example requires us to use the piecewise definition of the absolute value for both x and y.</p>
<p>Example 2.6: Graph |x|+|y|=4</p>
<p>We saw that in order to graph j x j we had to view the left and right sides separately. Similarly,
| y | divides the graph vertically.</p>
<p>On top, where y  0, | y |= y.</p>
<p>Where y < 0, on the bottom, | y |= ??y.</p>
<p>Since this equation has both variables under absolute values, we have to divide the graph both
horizontally and vertically, which means we look at each quadrant separately. j x j + j y j=
4</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Second Quadrant</td>
    <td>First Quadrant</td> 
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x  0, so | x |= ??x</td>
    <td>x  0, so | x |= x</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>y  0, so | y |= y</td>
    <td>y  0, so | y |= y</td> 
    
  </tr>  <tr>
    <td>(??x) + y = 4</td>
    <td>x + y = 4</td> 
    
  </tr>  <tr>
    <td>y = x + 4</td>
    <td>y = ??x + 4</td> 
    
  </tr>  <tr>
    <td>Third Quadrant</td>
    <td>Fourth Quadrant</td> 
    
  </tr>  <tr>
    <td>x  0, so | x |= ??x</td>
    <td>x  0, so | x |= x</td> 
    
  </tr>  <tr>
    <td>y  0, so | y |= ??y</td>
    <td>y  0, so | y |= ??y</td> 
    
  </tr>  <tr>
    <td>(??x) + (??y) = 4</td>
    <td>x + (??y) = 4</td> 
    
  </tr>  <tr>
    <td>y = ??x ?? 4</td>
    <td>y = x ?? 4</td> 
    
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Now we graph each line, but only in its respective quadrant. For instance, in the fourth quadrant,
we are graphing the line y = x ?? 4. So we draw the line, but use only the part of it that is in the
fourth quadrant.</p>
<p>PICTURE</p>

<p>Repeating this process in all four quadrants, we arrive at the proper graph.</p>
